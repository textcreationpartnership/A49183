            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF a Profeſt Enemy, or a Common and Known I yer had fallen foul upon us with his Tongue or Pen, and called us <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Arminian, Pelagian Hereticks, Corrupters of the Old,</hi> and <hi>Preachers of a New Goſpel;</hi> we ſhould have held our peace, and in ſilence deſpiſed his Lies and Revilings. But ſince a <hi>Brother</hi> who profeſſeth ſeriouſneſs in Religion, and hath ſome credit amongſt good People that fear God, and love the Truth and Purity of Chriſt's Goſpel, has publickly in Print proclaimed us to be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Preachers of a New Goſpel;</hi> our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would not ſuffer us any longer to keep ſilence: Becauſe it might have been juſtly interpreted to be an Argument and Evidence of our guilt, and good People might have thought that we could ſay nothing in our own defence; and therefore that they had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the uncontrolled Teſtimony of a ſerious Brother, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we are <hi>Hereticks indeed, Pelagian, Arminian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Corrupters of the Old, and Preachers of a New Goſpel.</hi> Wherefore to remedy this, and to undeceive the Lords People, and maintain the Truth and Purity of his Goſpel, with the credit of
<pb facs="tcp:93177:3"/>his Miniſtry, we judged our ſelves <hi>obliged in Conſcience</hi> to write and publiſh this Apology; wherein our deſign is to do wrong to <hi>no Man,</hi> no not to <hi>him</hi> who hath wronged us: But to do <hi>right</hi> unto the <hi>Truth,</hi> to <hi>clear up</hi> our own <hi>Innocency</hi> as to the things we are <hi>falſly</hi> charged with, and to let good people ſee that <hi>the teſtimony</hi> of our accuſer is <hi>not true;</hi> and therefore can be no proof that we are <hi>Heretical Preachers of a New Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Corrupters of the Old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we had <hi>ſtill kept ſilence</hi> and ſuppreſſed this Apology, all the World that ſhould have heard how we were accuſed, might have either <hi>ſuſpected us of Hereſie,</hi> or have <hi>blamed us</hi> (if guiltleſs,) <hi>for keeping ſilence, and ſuffering our Miniſtry to remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with ſuch a publick charge of Hereſie, unanſwered:</hi> But we are ſure <hi>none can have juſt cauſe</hi> to be offended with us for our now publiſhing it. Since if Men would ſuppoſe <hi>our caſe</hi> to be <hi>their own,</hi> and that a reputed ſerious good Man had in a printed Lybel accuſed <hi>them</hi> of damnable Hereſie, they cannot but <hi>ſee,</hi> That they ſhould <hi>judge</hi> it their <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> themſelves, and to clear up their own innocency as to that matter. Now if Men would <hi>judge thus,</hi> if it were their own caſe; right reaſon will aſſure them that they ſhould <hi>paſs</hi> the <hi>like judgment</hi> in our caſe, upon ſuppoſition that we know our ſelves not to be guilty of the Crime, which we are charged with. And <hi>the ſuppoſition</hi> is <hi>moſt certainly true,</hi> for we know <hi>as certainly</hi> that we are <hi>not guilty</hi> of that crime, as we know any other thing in the World; we know <hi>as certainly</hi> that we do not preach a New Goſpel, as we know that there is an Old Goſpel in the Church or World. So then, if we are to be blamed for any thing, it is for not doing this work <hi>ſooner;</hi> but for that we could alledge more Reaſons, than we need here to mention: It is enough to tell the World, that there being <hi>more than one</hi> con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erned <hi>in this cauſe,</hi> it was fit that we ſhould know one anothers mind, and proceed in it with one joint conſent, which it required <hi>ſome time</hi> to do. Whereunto we add, That the Collecting and <hi>Tranſcribing</hi> ſo many and large Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the Writings of Ancient and Modern Divines requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>yet more time;</hi> Moreover we profeſs our ſelves not to be of the number of thoſe who <hi>make boaſt of their quick and haſty Births,</hi> and boldly venture to publiſh unto the World <hi>any thing
<pb facs="tcp:93177:3"/>as it comes</hi> into their heads, without taking time to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſuch as will endure a <hi>ſtrict Tryal</hi> by the Rule of Truth and Righteouſneſs. If our Accuſer had taken more time to conſider of the ſeveral particulars of his Letter of <hi>Information,</hi> before he had printed it, we are apt to think that (if he be a good Man, as <hi>we would hope</hi> he is) he would have ſeen cauſe to have altered much of it, or to have <hi>ſuppreſſed it altogether,</hi> as well for his own particular good, as for the common good of Chriſt's Church. But it ſeems, that ſince all the World almoſt is ingaged in War at this day, he had an ambitious deſire to be a Warriour likewiſe; and that deſire <hi>(if he was not put on by others)</hi> would not let him be quiet, but he muſt ſound the Trumpet, and both, proclaim an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical War, and alſo himſelf make the firſt Attack. But f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r us, we are not of ſuch a Spirit; ſo far from it, that we have a <hi>real averſion</hi> to ſuch Eccleſiaſtical War, and are <hi>not eaſily</hi> brought to it: Indeed it is <hi>purely defenſive</hi> on our ſide, and we were <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>In the managing of it we have endeavoured no farther to <hi>offend</hi> the firſt aggreſſour, than was neceſſary to <hi>defend</hi> our ſelves. We are not conſcious to our ſelves of having given him <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> of offence, unleſs our refuting his errours, vindicating our ſelves from his Calumnies, and expoſing the weakneſs, and ſometimes the ridiculouſneſs of his reaſonings, be matter of offence to him. And if that be all, it is offence <hi>taken, not given,</hi> for which he <hi>may blame himſelf.</hi> For he having attackt us in <hi>ſuch Hoſtile, Rude, Unbrotherly and Unchriſtian manner,</hi> we could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his Attack, ſo as to ſecure the Truth of God, the Honour of Religion, and our own good Names, without anſwering him, as we have done. But if it ſhall be made <hi>appear</hi> to us, that in any thing we have <hi>paſſed</hi> the limits of a <hi>juſt ſelf-Defence;</hi> and have done him any <hi>real injury</hi> (which is more than we know,) we ſhall be ſorry for it, and willing to do him <hi>right.</hi> For we do really wiſh him well, and ſhould be ready to do him any <hi>office of love and kindneſs</hi> that lyes in our power. But we <hi>have no moral lawful power</hi> to ſuffer any Brother to throw Dirt on us, the <hi>vile Dirt of</hi> Pelagian <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and to hold our hands, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>to wipe it off again.</hi> Certainly <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> is <hi>one</hi> of the things in the whole World which <hi>we do moſt abhor. Jerome:</hi> (who was contemporary with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> writing againſt the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>

But if there ſhould be any of the Subſcribers, whom we have not conſulted with, who unknown to us, are of a Judgment different from us in theſe matters; we leave them to plead for themſelves. Yet though we thus write, we doubt not, but they will all <hi>agree</hi> to the <hi>Sum and Subſtance</hi> of what we have <hi>ſaid</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> in this our Apology. As <hi>(1.)</hi> That the Goſpel is a new Law of Grace in <hi>the Senſe</hi> we have affirmed and proved it ſo to be, by the Word of God, and by the Teſtimonies of Antient Fathers and Modern Divines. <hi>(2.)</hi> That this Law of Grace, or Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is conditional, <hi>as we have ſtated the conditionality of it,</hi> that is, It is conditional with reſpect to the ſubſequent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits of it, ſuch as Juſtification and Glorification. <hi>(3.)</hi> That Evangelical Repentance is a Condition <hi>Diſpoſitive of the Subject</hi> (Man), neceſſary in order to his being juſtified, as we have proved by Scripture and Reaſon, and by many Teſtimonies of Ancient Fathers and Modern Divines; And that a lively effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Faith is <hi>the Condition receptive and applicative</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> (Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs), by and for which <hi>only,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93177:5"/>Man is juſtified. Finally, That ſincere Evangelical Obedience proceeding from a Principle of true Faith, is a condition neceſſary on Mans part, unto his <hi>obtaining poſſeſſion</hi> of Eternal Salvation in Heaven, for the alone merits of Chriſt. <hi>(4.)</hi> That in effectual calling <hi>by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> there is a <hi>real change and holy qualifications</hi> wrought in the Soul of Man, <hi>in order of Nature before he</hi> be juſtified and pardoned. <hi>(5.)</hi> That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtinction is true, <hi>as we have explained it, and</hi> Calvin <hi>and the Synod of</hi> Dort approved it, That Chriſt dyed for all men <hi>ſufficiently;</hi> but for the Elect <hi>only, efficaciouſly.</hi> This is the ſumm of what we believe and here contend for, and we doubt not, but all the Subſcribers (even thoſe of them, whom we never ſaw) do and will agree to theſe things, which are the commonly received Doctrines of the Reformed Churches. And it is for <hi>ſuch</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that we make an Apology, and for no others. In pleading for theſe things aforeſaid, we are perſwaded in our own Conſcience, (and we think upon good and ſolid grounds) that we plead for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of the Goſpel; the <hi>defence</hi> whereof <hi>to the Glory of God,</hi> is the principal thing that we propoſe to our ſelves in this preſent Apology: And <hi>next to God's Glory</hi> in the defence of his Truth, we deſign the <hi>Edification and Common Good</hi> of Chriſt's Church, and the defence of our ſelves only <hi>in ſubſervien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to</hi> thoſe higher ends. That the Father of Lights, the God of Truth and Love, and Peace, would pour out upon us all, of all perſwaſions, a Spirit of Light and Love, Purity and Peace, that we may all ſee the Truth with our minds, believe and love it with our hearts, and profeſs and practice it purely and peaceably in our lives, to the Glory of God in Chriſt, to the Honour of Religion, and to the Spiritual and Eternal good of our own and others Souls, is and through Grace ſhall be our fervent and frequent Prayer unto him that is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think;
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.20, 21.</note> unto whom be Glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all Ages, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>HOly <hi>David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart, ſaid of old, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.120.</note> and I am afraid of thy judgments.</hi> We would it were thus with all that pretend to any ſeriouſneſs in the Profeſſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, at this day. But alas! where are ſuch to be found? where are they that are affected with the fear of God, as <hi>David</hi> was, and that are duly apprehenſive of the Judgments of God, which are actually upon, and ſeem to be yet further coming upon the Reformed Churches? Is it not viſible, that all ſorts of men turn to their ſeveral courſes of ſin, as the Horſe ruſheth into the battle. They run on in the ways of their own hearts, blindly and boldly without conſidering or fearing the iſſue. And who can wonder, that thoſe who have hardned their hearts from Gods fear, ſhould boldly venture upon ſin, eſpecially if they have got a ſtrong, but falſe perſwaſion, that they are <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> the true, the beſt, and pureſt Church upon Earth, moſt highly in favour with God, and that their ſins are the ſpots of Gods children, which do not hurt them, and are well conſiſtent with his higheſt Love and Favour. The Scriptures of truth aſſure us, that when once Profeſſors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have brought themſelves to this, then they can ſecurely <hi>lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord amongſt us? none evil can come upon us.</hi> Though at the ſame time, the Lord ſaith, that <hi>Sion for your ſakes ſhall be plowed as a field, and Jeruſalem ſhall become heaps.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 3.11, 12.</note> We wiſh it be not ſo with us at this day. But when we look abroad into the World, and into the preſent ſtate of the Reformed Churches at home and abroad, and ſee, or hear, what lives Men generally lead, how they fight againſt God, and againſt one another; againſt God by tranſgreſſing all his holy, juſt, and good Laws, and by turning his Grace into Laſciviouſneſs: And againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by injuſtice and uncharitableneſs, by malice and envy, by lying and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We cannot but fear, that God is <hi>againſt us, and will fight againſt us, as we are againſt him,
<note place="margin">Levit. 26.23, 24.</note> and fight against him.</hi> And it greatly encreaſes our fear, to ſee that thoſe, who pretend to greateſt ſeriouſneſs in Religion, have lately fallen out, and have been quarrelling together about ſuch a practical point of Religion as that is, <hi>Whether true Repentance is neceſſary before we can obtain from God the pardon of our ſins, through the alone ſatisfaction, and Merits of Chriſt.</hi> When God is loudly calling us to Repentance, for obtaining the pardon of our ſins, and we ſhould all be found in the practice of Repentance, in order to that end; we are like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fallen to diſputing, Whether our Repentance be neceſſary, before we are pardoned, when we are pardoned, or after we are pardoned. And there are thoſe amongſt us, who have raiſed a great clamour againſt ſuch honeſt, and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, as dare tell, and dare not but tell the People, that they muſt truly repent of their ſins, before they can obtain the pardon of them;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93177:7"/>although at the ſame time they aſſure the people, from the Lord, that God, for Chriſts ſake, will moſt certainly pardon them, immediately after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. This is cried out againſt, as dangerous Doctrine, by a ſort of Religious People amongſt us, who will have it, that Repentance is only neceſſary after God hath pardoned us, but not before. And though to pleaſe theſe People, ſome Miniſters have openly granted, That Repentance, and pardon of Sin, are <hi>ſimultaneous</hi> in time, that is, they are not one before another for any ſpace of time, but are both together; only Repentance is firſt in order of Nature, by the grace thereof to diſpoſe, and prepare us for receiving our Pardon by Faith in Chriſts Blood: Yet this will not give them content, but they will have their <hi>Pardon before Repentance;</hi> and the Miniſters who preach, or write otherwiſe, ſhall be proclaimed to be Antichriſtian, Arminian, or any thing that Paſſion ſuggeſts. This, we ſay, greatly encreaſeth our fears; for to us it ſeems evident, that the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> is in this matter, that is plainly, that Satan has a wicked deſign, by this means, to keep the People from Repentance; and ſo from obtaining the pardon of their ſins, that the deſolating Judgments of God may come upon the Nation, and that we may be all deſtroyed together. And that Satan may not be diſcovered, he hath artificially diſguiſed himſelf, and appears on the Stage, transformed into an Angel of Light, pleading for the exaltation of the glorious riches of free grace, in the Juſtification of Sinners by the Blood of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all works of any Law whatſoever; and with great appearance of Zeal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting. That the freeneſs of Gods Grace in the Juſtification of Sinners by Faith in the Blood, Merits, and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, cannot poſſibly be maintained, unleſs it be denyed, that true Repentance is antecedently neceſſary to our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pardon of our Sins. It ſeems to us, that this is Satans Plot againſt us, and that he hath thus diſguiſed himſelf, the better to carry it on, and the more effectually to compaſs his deſign upon us: And this is the more probable; becauſe we find, that at the beginning of the Reformation Satan plaid the ſame game, when he perceived, that by our firſt Reformers preaching up Juſtification by Faith only, and not by Works, many People were induced to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and embrace the Reformation; he endeavoured to make them believe, that ſince Sinners are Juſtified, and Pardoned by Faith only, and not by Works; then there was no neceſſity, that they ſhould repent of their Sins, in order to their obtaining the Pardon of them: And thus he thought, that though they had got their feet looſed out of one of his Snares, yet he ſhould ſtill keep them faſt in another, and lead them Captive at his will. That this is ſo indeed, and no Fiction of ours, is manifeſt from the Teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> that bleſſed, faithful, and valiant Martyr of Chriſt; who, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> was burnt alive, for the Proteſtant Religion, in a ſlow Fire, about the ſpace of three quarters of an hour; and ſealed the Truth of the Goſpel with his blood. This Man of God, in a Book of his Intituled, <hi>A Declaration of Chriſt and his Office,</hi> Printed at <hi>Zurich,</hi> in the Year 1547. Chap. VII <hi>th.</hi> handling the point of Juſtification, ſaith, <hi>This is certain. and too true, Let the whole Goſpel be preached unto the World; as it ought to be, Repentance and a vertuous Life with Faith, as God preached the Goſpel unto</hi> Adam <hi>in Paradiſe,</hi> Noah, Abraham, Moſes, Iſaiah, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Vae Genti Peccatrici, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Iſa. 1.4, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) John the Baptiſt, <hi>repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand: As Christ did, Repent and believe the Goſpel,</hi> Mark 1. <hi>and then of an hundred that come to the Goſpel, there would not come one. When they hear ſole (or only) faith, and the mercy of God to juſtify, and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93177:7"/>they may eat all ments, at all times, with thanksgiving; they embrace that Goſpel with all joy, and willing heart. And what is he that would not receive this Goſpel? the fleſh it ſelf, were there no immortal ſoul in it, would receive this Goſpel, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth aid, help, and conſolation, without Works. But now ſpeak of the other part of the Goſpel, as</hi> Paul <hi>teacheth,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye; And as he preſcribeth the life of a Juſtified man, in the ſame Epiſtle,</hi> Chap. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>And Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 10. <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>in the</hi> 2 Epiſtle <hi>and</hi> 1 Chap. <hi>This part of the Goſpel is not ſo pleaſant; therefore Men take the firſt liberty,</hi> &amp;c. Thus that bleſſed Saint, who feared neither Man nor Devil, but in the true faith, and fear of God, ſet himſelf with a Divine courage and holy boldneſs, to oppoſe the Devil and all his Inſtruments, to deſtroy his Kingdome in the World; and on the contrary, to exalt the Name, and Glory of God, and to ſet up Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom in the hearts and lives of Men. Would to God! that we had many <hi>Hoopers</hi> amongſt us at this day; who ſaith again, in the ſame Chapter, not far from the beginning, <hi>Nothing maketh the cauſe wherefore this mercy (to wit of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) ſhould be given, ſaving, only the death of Chriſt, which is the</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>the only ſufficient Price, and Gage for ſin. And although it be neceſſary, and requiſite, that in the Juſtification of a Sinner, contrition be preſent, and that neceſſarily cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and vertuous life, muſt follow; yet doth the Scripture attribute onely remiſſion of ſin unto the mercy of God, which is given onely for the Merits of Chriſt, and received ſolely by Faith.</hi> Paul <hi>doth not exclude thoſe vertues to be preſent, but he excludeth the merits of thoſe vertues, and deriveth the cauſe of our acceptation into the grace of God onely for Christ.</hi> If we could all be ſo wiſe and humble, as to learn of that holy Man, and to follow him, as he learned of, and followed Chriſt and his Apoſtles; we might yet defeat Satan, as to the foreſaid Plot that he is carrying on to ruine us. But alas! it grieves us to the heart, that ſome Miniſters, by not watching againſt that moſt ſubtile malicious enemy of God and Man, have ſuffered themſelves to be impoſed upon ſo far as to turn (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>Accuſers of the Brethren;</hi> who ſtand up for God and Man, in oppoſition to Satan, and faithfully tell the People, that they muſt, through Grace, truly repent of their ſins, in order to obtain the pardon of them.</p>
            <p>And particularly, we are truly ſorry, that the Authour of the <hi>Letter from a Minister in the City, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould have medled in this matter, and that he ſhould become <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe pious <hi>Young Men,</hi> who gave themſelves up to the work of the Miniſtry in difficult and dangerous times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible encouragement thereunto from any thing in this World; and alſo againſt groat viſible diſcouragements, both from the World, and the Devil. What have thoſe <hi>Younger Brethren</hi> done to provoke this Brother (who is himſelf alſo one of the younger ſort) to become their Accuſer? Some of us, who are Older than they, have known ſeveral of them theſe many years; and yet never knew any evil by them, nor heard any evil of them. Since we firſt knew them, it hath to us looked like a Token for good to his People in this Nation, that the Lord hath raiſed up ſo many young men, and hath ſpirited, and to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree gifted them for the Miniſtry under ſuch diſcouraging circumſtances. But now after all that God hath done for, and by thoſe Brethren, notwithſtanding the preſence of God with them, and the bleſſing of God upon their Labours; up ſtarts one, who calls himſelf a Miniſter in the City, and accuſes them of being <hi>Corrupters of the pure Goſpel of Christ,</hi> of <hi>new vamping an Arminian Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>obtruding it on the People,
<note place="margin">Let. <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</note> to the certain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93177:8"/>peril of their Souls that believe it.</hi> Yea, he raiſeth the Charge higher in <hi>pag.</hi> 13. and ſaith, That <hi>Judicious Obſervers cannot but already perceive a coincidency between their cauſe, and that of thoſe two Pests of the Church,</hi> Pelagius <hi>and</hi> Arminius; <hi>and do fear more, when, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Here is an high Charge indeed; but where is there any <hi>evidence</hi> for all this? One would think, that no Man, who pretends ſuch relation unto Chriſt, and ſuch ſeriouſneſs in Chriſtian Religion, as this Man doth, ſhould dare thus to accuſe his Brethren, and fellow-Miniſters, of ſuch horrid Crimes, without clear, and certain evidence, whereby he can prove them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For if Men be ſuffered to accuſe one another of atrocious Crimes, without being obliged to <hi>prove</hi> their accuſation, no Man will be able to preſerve his Good Name, nor will it be poſſible for Men to live peaceably together in any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, Civil or Religious. This Brother therefore ought to have been made to <hi>prove</hi> his accuſation, that the Churches might have been delivered from thoſe <hi>young Hereticks,</hi> if he had proved them to be ſuch: Or, if he had failed in his proof, that the Churches might know <hi>what ſpirit he is of,</hi> who hath kindled a Fire in the Church, by traducing the Miniſters of Chriſt, and falſely accuſing them of Hereſie.</p>
            <p>But ſome may poſſibly ſay, Hath he not by his printed Letter proved them guilty of <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie? To which we anſwer, that no Man of Judgment, who reads it, can ſee any ſuch proof in it; nor indeed ſee juſt cauſe to harbour any ſuch Thought of them, if he but know the Men accuſed, have heard their Doctrine, and ſeen their manner of life; and if withal he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Pelagianiſm and Arminianiſm are.</p>
            <p>It is true, he boldly accuſes them of Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm, and of preaching a new Goſpel; and to make the ſimple People believe that his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is well grounded, he ſaies, that <hi>Judicious Obſervers perceive their cauſe to be coincident with that of</hi> Pelagius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they are reſerved, and do not yet ſpeak out upon ſuch and ſuch points, and that they hold ſuch things, as are utterly inconſiſtent with the Freeneſs of Gods Grace in Juſtifying Sinners, by the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Merits of Chriſts Blood. Theſe things are often affirmed, or inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, throughout the Letter; but none of them <hi>proved.</hi> A Monſter, or a Man of Straw, of his own making, is ſet up to repreſent the Brethren; and then he calls upon the People to come, and ſee with what a Spirit of Zeal he hews it all in pieces. This is a way of writing, that is taking with weak, well-meaning People;
<note place="margin">Let. <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15, 30.</note> and his holding <hi>Repentance not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to the obtaining pardon of ſin,</hi> may be pleaſing to Satan, and very taking with Hypocrites; but no body of Judgment, and Underſtanding, can ever think, that this is the way to prove the foreſaid Accuſation in <hi>matter of fact.</hi> For our parts we have diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered every Paragraph of his Letter, and, in it all, cannot find one proof of the ſaid Accuſation: And after all, we believe in our conſciences, that the Brethren accuſed are innocent of the Crime he lays to their charge. Indeed, we know aſſuredly, that ſeveral of them are innocent thereof; and till the contrary be proved, and appear, we muſt think ſo of them all: We would have all Men to do ſo by us, in caſe we were falſely accuſed, and it is but juſt and reaſonable, that we do as we would be done by. If we ſhould happen to be miſtaken, as to any of the Brethren, whoſe cauſe we plead, we err on the ſafer ſide;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note> for <hi>charity thinketh no evil.</hi> True Love will not ſuffer a Chriſtian heart to entertain a deliberate Thought of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93177:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Brother, that he is an ill Man, or an Heretick, without ſufficient evidence that he is ſo.</p>
            <p>We have met with no ſuch evidence, either in the aforeſaid Letter, or any where elſe; and therefore we muſt ſtill think, that the accuſed Brethren are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the Crime they are charged with: and that the Accuſer of them (if he be a good man yet) hath done a very ill thing in <hi>ſtandering</hi> the Lords Miniſters; and we heartily pray God to give him repentance, and forgiveneſs for Chriſts ſake.</p>
            <p>And that the World may ſee, and that this Brother himſelf may ſee, how raſh, and unchriſtian a thing, he hath done, in accuſing the Brethren, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. We,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. And yet further, to remove all ground of ſuſpicion (if it be poſſible) of our corrupting the Goſpel in the point of Juſtification, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> propoſed to us by the Authour of the Letter,

But by Comparing the confeſſion of Faith with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, we find, that the Aſſembly held Faith to be both an Inſtrument, and a Condition: And therefore every honeſt Man that will ſubſcribe in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies own ſenſe, muſt ſo hold Faith to be an Inſtrument, as to be a Condition alſo. Now the Queſtion is, How Faith can be <hi>both an Inſtrument, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi> To which we anſwer, That in our Judgement it is thus. Diſtinguiſh between a <hi>meer Phyſical</hi> Inſtrument, and a <hi>moral federal</hi> Inſtrument. Faith is not a meer phyſical Inſtrument; but it is a moral federal Inſtrument. Now a moral federal Inſtrument is the ſame thing with a federal Condition. Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Condition, in this ſenſe, are but two words to ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>If this do not ſatisfie our Brother, but he will ſtill ſay, That the notion of an Inſtrument, and the notion of a Condition, are two diſtinct notions, and cannot both agree to the ſame thing, to the ſame faith. We anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he will ſay ſo, we deſire the World to take notice, that it is <hi>he</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who oppoſes the Aſſembly, and not we.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In behalf of the Aſſembly, we anſwer, That the notion of a moral fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtrument, and the notion of a federal Condition, are not two diſtinct, but one and the ſame notion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe they were two diſtinct notions, yet the ſame thing, the ſame faith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93177:9"/>in different reſpects, is capable of two diſtinct notions: But ſo it is, that Faith may be conſidered under two different reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Faith is conſidered with reſpect to Chriſt himſelf, and his Righteouſneſs; and ſo it hath the notion of an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> whereby we receive Him and His Righteouſneſs, and apply them to our own Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Faith is conſidered with reſpect to Juſtification it ſelf, or the Act whereby God Juſtifies us for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs; and ſo it hath the notion of a <hi>Condition,</hi> upon which God Juſtifies us, for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>In this reſpect, Faith cannot have the notion of a <hi>Phiſical Instrument;</hi> for a <hi>Phyſical Instrument,</hi> as ſuch, hath a <hi>Phyſical Cauſality;</hi> but our Faith cannot have a <hi>Phyſical Cauſality</hi> upon <hi>Gods Act,</hi> whereby he Juſtifies.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered, that both our Catechiſms, larger and leſſer, affirm Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be an Act of God. Now how an <hi>Act of ours,</hi> ſuch as Juſtifying Faith is, can have a Phiſical Cauſality, and Influence, upon the producing of an <hi>Act of God,</hi> is above our comprehenſion. Sure we are, that if any Man will maintain ſuch an Opinion, he aſcribes more to Faith in the point of Juſtification, than we dare do. We ſhould rather think, that the Inſtrument, which God uſes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his own Juſtifying Act, is his own <hi>Goſpel-promiſe</hi> of Pardon and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the penitent Believer, for the ſake of Chriſt, in whom he believes, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the ſecond Article of the</hi> II Chap. <hi>of the Confeſſion of Faith, ſay expreſly, that Faith is the alone Inſtrument of Justification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And ſo ſay we too: It is the alone Inſtrument, the alone moral fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtrument, or the alone receptive, applicative Condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſtinguiſh between an Inſtrument immediate, and mediate.</p>
            <p>Now Faith is not ſaid to be the alone immediate Inſtrument of Juſtification, nor do we conceive how it can ſo be in a phyſical ſenſe; becauſe it hath no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate phyſical influence upon the producing of Gods Juſtifying Act. But Faith may be ſaid to be the mediate Inſtrument of Juſtification, becauſe it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſtrument whereby we receive Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs; <hi>&amp; hoc poſito,</hi> this being done, this Inſtrumental Means being uſed, and this Condition being performed, Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs being received by Faith, as the Inſtrumental Means of that reception, God himſelf, for Chriſts ſake, juſtifies us by his Law of Faith.</p>
            <p>This ſeems plainly to be the ſenſe of the Aſſembly, as appears by their ſaying in the paſſage of the larger Catechiſm, quoted by the Letter, <hi>That Faith Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Sinner, onely as it is an Instrument, by which the Sinner receiveth, and applieth Christ and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Mark the Expreſſion, They do not ſay, that Faith Juſtifies only, as an Inſtrument whereby God Juſtifies the Sinner; but onely, as an Inſtrument whereby the Sinner receives, and applies, Chriſt and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p>If the Authour of the Letter have any other Notions of Faith's being a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument, much good may they do him; but let him not think to impoſe them upon us, or upon the Words of the Aſſembly: We take their Words in the ſenſe they are capable of, without ſelf contradiction. For we have more reſpect for that Reverend, and learned <hi>Synod,</hi> than to put a ſenſe upon their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93177:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>Words, they are not fairly capable of, or that ſhall make them ſpeak Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Therefore as they hold Faith to be <hi>both an Instrument, and a Condition,</hi> ſo do <hi>we:</hi> We hold it ſo to be an Inſtrument, as that its being an Inſtrument, ſhall not hinder it from being a Condition: And ſo to be a Condition, as that its being a Condition, ſhall not hinder it from being an Inſtrument. This we take to be the plain and native ſenſe of the Aſſembly; and in this ſenſe we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent to their Words. But ſo doth not our Authour; for in the 9th. and 25th. Pages of his Letter, he ſaith, that <hi>Faith is neither Condition, nor Qualification; but a meer Instrument:</hi> Whereas the Aſſembly ſaith expreſly, both that Faith is a <hi>Condition,</hi> and alſo, that it is an <hi>Instrument.</hi> Therefore <hi>he</hi> contradicts the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: and doth not take their Words in their plain and native ſenſe: For had he ſo taken them, as we do, and always did, what reaſon had he to make ſuch a clamour; and with what <hi>Conſcience</hi> did he tell the World that his Brethren, the Non conformiſts (eſpecially the <hi>younger</hi> ſort of them) were dangerouſly erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in the Fundamental point of Juſtification?</p>
            <p>Is it a light matter with him to traduce the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt? For our parts, we durſt not have done ſo by him, or any of his Conſorts, without as clear evidence as a matter of fact, of that nature, is capable of, and without producing our evidence too; which he hath not done in his Letter, nor is it poſſible to be done; for the matter of fact is moſt certainly, and evidently falſe. And we would yet hope, that he will have a better opinion of his Brethren, and be ſorry for the wrong he hath done them, when he ſhall underſtand that they are far from being the Men he affirmed them to be; and that they willingly accept of the Teſt, which he himſelf offers, in order to an Agreement; not as if they had <hi>changed their Judgments,</hi> upon the reading of his Letter (which is more likely to make Proſelytes of weak well meaning Women, than of Men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) but becauſe they <hi>were of the ſame Judgment before,</hi> and now declare it, that the World, and he, may ſee how injurious he hath been to his Brethren.</p>
            <p>But though we are willing to agree with him, in the foreſaid Articles of the Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith; yet it is upon Condition, that he will aſſent to the Aſſemblies Words, in their plain, and genuine ſenſe aforeſaid, as we alſo do: And that this ſhall not be accounted an agreement with him in all the reſt of his Letter. For we hope, by the help of our God and Saviour, never to agree unto many things in his Letter; becauſe they are neither conſiſtent with the purity of Faith, nor with the ſincerity of Love.</p>
            <p>We are indeed willing that it ſhould be known, to the real and right Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, that he is none of them; if he will ſtand to ſeveral Paſſages in his Letter; particularly, to what he writes in the end of the 4th, and in the 5th. Pages, again in the end of the 23d., and beginning of the 24th. Pages; as alſo in Page 40. Line 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. And for our parts, if he would be <hi>conſistent with himſelf,</hi> and not contradict what he there owns for Truth; we ſhould be willing and ready, as we have occaſion, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him from being an Antinomian in Principle; but we cannot acquit him from being an Antinomian in Practice, ſo long as it is written in our Bibles, <hi>[Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy Neighbour:]</hi> And ſo long as he approves of thoſe Paſſages in his Letter, whereby he has falſely accuſed, and traduced his Brethren, and repreſented them to the World, as Arminians, and Pelagians, and Preachers of a new Goſpel.</p>
            <p>It is none of our buſineſs to perſwade any Body to believe, that he is a real
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93177:10"/>Antinomian in Principle; but it is to Vindicate our own innocency, by wiping off thoſe moſt falſe, and ſoul Aſperſions, he hath caſt upon the Lords Miniſters; and to correct ſome of thoſe groſs miſtakes, that occur up and down in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and to let People ſee, that ſome have been too forward to receive for truth many things which he hath preſented them with in his Letter.</p>
            <p>This is that, which we deſign in Animadverting upon his Letter, and our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in doing it, ſhall be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the firſt Chapter to conſider of the Occaſion, and Deſign of his Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the ſecond Chapter, divided into ſeveral Sections, to refute ſome of his Doctrinal Errors againſt the purity of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the third Chapter, to ſhew that we cannot approve his ridiculous way of Converting Unbelievers, and bringing them to Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the fourth Chapter, to refute his Calumnies, and falſe Accuſations of Chriſts Miniſters, againſt the ſincerity of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> In the fifth Chapter, to adviſe Chriſtian People to try before they truſt, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed upon, and lead into errour by the bold, unproved Aſſertions and Dictates of any Preachers, or Writers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Concerning the Occaſion and Deſign of the Letter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrſt of all, We will conſider the Occaſion and Deſign of his Letter. And for the Occaſion of his Writing it, he ſaith, It was a Countrey Miniſters earneſt deſire of information about ſome difference amongſt Non-conformiſts in <hi>London,</hi> which was the cauſe of it: We ſuppoſe, he means the occaſional cauſe. And if this be true, we allow it for a lawful occaſion of writing a Letter of Information to his Friend and Brother in the Country, provided his Information had been true; but nothing can ever make it lawful to give falſe information to any, either in City or Countrey. Whether he hath done ſo, or not, by his Letter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what follows in this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Next, for his deſign in writing, he ſaith, in Page 35. That, <hi>All his deſign in publiſhing that Letter, was plainly and briefly to give ſome information to ordinary plain people, who either want time, or judgment, to peruſe large and learned Tractates, about the point of Juſtification, wherein every one is equally concerned.</hi> We do not believe this to be true, yea we think it is not true: For ſurely it was part of his deſign to give a fuller information to his Brother in the Countrey, who being, as he ſaith, a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> we preſume he is none of <hi>the plain ordinary people, who want time, and judgment, to peruſe large, and learned Tractates, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not think, that he firſt ſent the whole Manuſcript in a private Letter, into the Country, to inform a Miniſter; and afterwards printed it, to inform the People, that want time and judgment: But that if he did really write a Letter into the Countrey, it was but a ſmall part, it may be ſome of the Heads of it;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Lett. p.</hi> 27.</note> and then publiſhed the whole with a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93177:10"/>deſign to inform, and to alarum too, both Miniſters and People in City and Countrey.</p>
            <p>And whether this be ſo, or not, yet we cannot believe that <hi>All his deſign</hi> in publiſhing his Letter, was plainly, and briefly to give ſome Information to the People about the point of Juſtification. For he plainly manifeſts, throughout his Letter, that <hi>a part of his deſign</hi> in writing, was to vindicate himſelf, and ſome of his Party, from the ſuſpicion of Antinomianiſm, and to load other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who differ from him in ſome things, with the odious charge of Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm; and to warn the People, upon their peril, to have a care of ſuch Miniſters (as preach <hi>the neceſſity of Repentance in order to pardon of ſin,</hi>) that they be not corrupted by them, in moſt Fundamental points of Religion. Let any body, of common underſtanding, but read Pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30. of the Letter, and he cannot but ſee, that the main deſign of the Writer was to clear himſelf, and his Party, of the ſuſpicion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm, and to bring the other Miniſters, who are not of their mind in all things, under the ſuſpicion of Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm. This ſeems plainly to have been his <hi>principal</hi> deſign; and therefore he knows well enough, that it is not true, <hi>That all his deſign</hi> in publiſhing his Letter, was to inform ordinary plain People, about the point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>If he will yet ſay that it was <hi>All his</hi> deſign in publiſhing his Letter to inform the <hi>People that want Judgment</hi> to peruſe learned Tractates, we hope no body, that do not love to be deceived, will believe him. But, if any ſhould believe him, we would ask them; was not he then a <hi>wiſe Informer</hi> of the injudicious People,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Let. p.</hi> 6.</note> to tell them of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and that it is the believing Chriſts Righteouſneſs to be the <hi>matter,</hi> and not only the meritorious cauſe; and the imputation of it to be the <hi>form</hi> of Juſtification, which differenceth us from the Papiſts, who own the reſt of our Doctrine in the point of Juſtification, (as the ſimple People muſt be made to believe,) but err in their notions about the matter and form of it?</p>
            <p>Further, we ask, Was he not a wiſe Informer of the ignorant People, to tell them, Page 13, That God bleſſed <hi>England</hi> with a <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> ſince a popiſh Prieſt can demonſtrate before any indifferent Perſons of underſtanding in thoſe matters, that <hi>Bradwardine</hi> was of the popiſh opinion, both as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> of Juſtification, and that he was a downright Papiſt in that point; and held Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>not by Chriſts imputed righteouſneſs, but, by infuſed grace and inherent holyneſs;</hi> as ſhall be hereafter manifeſted from his own expreſs Words.</p>
            <p>A wiſe Informer indeed of the injudicious People, to tell them of a <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine,</hi> who was ſo ſubtil, ſo Metaphyſical, and Mathematical in his way of Writing, that he was commonly called <hi>The profound Doctor;</hi> and to tell them too, that he was a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> who held <hi>Juſtification by inherent Righteouſneſs:</hi> And yet at the ſame time to tell them, that it is a moſt dangerous, damnable errour, inconſiſtent with the Glory of Gods Free Grace in Juſtification, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Souls of Men, to believe that which <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> believed, and profeſſed; or to differ from him,

            <p>But, it may be, ſome will ſay, that he had <hi>no deſign at all,</hi> in publiſhing thoſe parts of his Letter, but that they dropt from his Pen by meer accident. If any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93177:11"/>ſhould thus Apologize for him; there needs no more to confure them, but to turn to, and read Pag. 6. Lin. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. of his Letter, and Pag. 13. throughout: For there it is, as clear as the Light at Noon-day, that his deſign in publiſhing thoſe parts of his Letter was to bring us under the ſuſpicion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Arminianiſm, and Pelagianiſm, that we agree with the Papiſts, and they with us, in the point of Juſtification; and that both in that, and other points, we are Arminians, and Pelagians; and that in all we are Corrupters of the Goſpel in the main points of it, in the points of neceſſary ſaving Faith; and that we have <hi>Twiſs</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> againſt us, and not them onely, but we have <hi>Doctorem profundum,</hi> the proſound Doctor <hi>Bradwardine</hi> for our Adverſary, even that Doctor, who prayed to God in theſe Words, <hi>Exurge, Domine, Judiea cauſam tuam, &amp; ſuſtinentem te ſuſtine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, Judge thine own cauſe, and uphold me, who uphold thee,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>We need ſay no more, to prove that it was part of the Writer of the Letters deſign, to inform his Friend, the Countrey Miniſter, and other Miniſters like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we are leavened with Popery, that we are Arminians and Pelagians; and that as we have <hi>Twiſs</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> ſo we have the profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: And therefore it muſt be an untruth, That <hi>All his deſign,</hi> in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Letter, was to give ſome information unto the injudicious People, about the point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>That it was a <hi>part</hi> of his deſign to inform the injudicious People, we do not deny, and how judiciouſly he hath done it, let them that can, judge; but that that was <hi>all his deſign,</hi> we have ſhewed reaſon why we cannot believe. We doubt not but he deſigned, <hi>Populo ut placerent, quas feciſſet fabulas,</hi> to gratifie thoſe People, who are diſaffected to us, with his ſtories of our being Arminians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pelagians, and Corrupters of the pure Goſpel of Chriſt and of the Doctrine of Gods Free Grace in the Juſtification of Sinners by Faith in Chriſts Blood. Now whether this was an honeſt deſign or not, we ſhall refer to the judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of all unbyaſſed, unprejudiced Perſons after they have heard and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what we have ſaid for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>We think it is ſelf-evident alſo from his Letter, that it was a part of his deſign to clear himſelf, and his Party, from the ſuſpicion of Antinomianiſm and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm.

And in pag. 5. gives in, a brief Summ of their Doctrine; after which, at the end of the page, he asks theſe Queſtions, <hi>What is there in all this to be offended with? Is not this enough to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our Doctrine from any tendency to Licentiouſneſs?</hi> And pag 39. theſe are his own expreſs Words, <hi>But how unjuſtly this hateful Name (Antinomian) is charged upon the Orthodox, Preachers, and ſincere Believers of the Proteſtant Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith only — is the deſign of this Paper to diſcover.</hi> Now that ſolemn prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93177:11"/>aforeſaid, that Sum of their Doctrine, thoſe Expoſtulatory Demands thereupon, together with his own Confeſſion in formal expreſs words, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhew, that a part of his deſign was to clear himſelf and his Party, from the ſuſpicion of Antinomianiſm and Libertiniſm. And we heartily wiſh, that he had no worſe deſign than this: For we freely acknowledge, that any perſon, or party, who find themſelves unjuſtly ſuſpected of, and charged with horrid crimes, whereof they know themſelves not to be guilty, may, and ought to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the beſt way they can; and if they cannot do it by Word, they may very honeſtly do it by Writing: provided that in clearing themſelves, they do not falſely accuſe others, and ſo fall into the ſame fault, which they blame others for, which if they do, aſſuredly they take wrong meaſures; for all conſidering Men will be apt to ſuſpect them more than ever of Libertiniſm, when they plainly ſee that they run themſelves into Libertine practices, in order to clear themſelves of Libertine principles.</p>
            <p>But after all he hath ſaid of his Party, their being falſely accuſed of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm, and that they could no longer be ſilent,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Let. pag.</hi> 10.</note> but muſt ſpeak and write in their own defence, and in defence of the Goſpel; we are at a loſs to know, who they are that ſo accuſed them. We can find no ſuch thing in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Book, nay we find that in it, which clears the chief of them of the charge of Antinomianiſm. At the beginning of the Digreſſion, Concerning the neceſſity of Repentance to forgiveneſs of Sin, pag. 113. theſe are Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Words <hi>[My buſineſs in this Digreſſion is with Men of more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Principles,]</hi> to wit, than the Antinomians. There is one whom we know, as well as any Man in the World, to whom Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, before his Book was all printed off, <q>This is ſaid with reſpect to Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> him I mean, and here I endeavour to ſtate, and make up the difference between him and Dr. <hi>Bates.</hi>
               </q> Hereupon that Miniſter looked into the Digreſſion, and read ſome part of it, which he liked ſo well, as thinking it might be very uſeful both to conſirm Truth, and alſo to maintain Peace and Love among. Brethren, that it was to him one motive (amongſt others) which induced him to ſubſcribe unto the ſtating of the truths and errours in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Book. This we know to be true, we know it as certainly, as any other thing in the World; and we mention it to ſhow, that we did not ſuſpect that Party, (as our Authour hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſtinguiſh them) much leſs did we accuſe them of real Antinomianiſm. So far were we from it, that we were heartily glad to find that our Reverend Brother had expreſly owned them to be Men of more Orthodox Principles than the Antinomians: againſt whom, and no other, that Book was written.</p>
            <p>How comes it then to be ſo often aſſerted, or inſinuated, throughout the Letter, that we falſely accuſe them,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See p.</hi> 26.</note> and charge them with Antinomianiſm, and put them upon a neceſſary ſelf-defence? We think we are wronged in this matter, and muſt think ſo, till we ſee better, proof than the bare word of this Authour. Or if any of us had really been ſo unjuſt and uncharitable, as to accuſe their whole Party of Antinomianiſm, did that warrant this Brother falſely to Recriminate as he hath done, and to charge us, eſpecially our younger Brethren with Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm? Where did he learn ſuch Morals? Sure we are, not in the School of Chriſt: For Chriſt hath taught us all, not to render evil for evil. This we ſay upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſome of us had, ſometime or other, done him wrong in this matter; which is unknown to us.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93177:12"/>
            <p>But if there was no ſuch provocation given, then this Authour was the more to blame, to fancy, or feign, that we had accuſed his Party of Antinomianiſm, that from thence he might take an occaſion, to accuſe us of Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm. As for what any of us have, at any time, ſpoken or written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Antinomian Tenents in Dr. <hi>Criſps,</hi> or ſuch Books, we thought it did not at all concern them, as being Men of <hi>more Orthodox Principles.</hi> Tho' we could not be ignorant, that there was ſome little difference of Judgment between ſome of them, and us in ſome things, yet we did not think, nor ſay, that that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amounted to Antinomianiſm on their ſide; nor could we have ever thought (till the Letter informed us) they would have ſaid, that it amounted to Arminianiſm and Pelagianiſm on our ſide. But now we find we are miſtaken, for they have made us know that they had not ſo good an opinion of us, as we had of them. Yet we had rather be miſtaken in this, than in the other, that is, we had rather they ſhould, without cauſe, think us to be Arminians and Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; than that ever we ſhould have juſt cauſe to conclude any of them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Antinomians. They tell the World, by the Authour of the Letter, that they have been ſuſpected. And we are afraid the late Writings of ſome of them, will increaſe the ſuſpicion: But what ever ſuſpicious Thoughts may be thereby raiſed in the minds of many; we will endeavour to hinder ſuch Thoughts from ſetling in our own Minds, and ſtill have the beſt opinion we can of our Brethren, till we ſee further what the iſſue will be. We do not then now account that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be really Antinomian (whatever Mens Thoughts may be of ſome particular perſons amongſt them,) and we hope, and wiſh we may never have cauſe ſo to do. The Authour of the Letter, in their name, hath moſt ſolemnly proteſted, that they are not Antinomians, and we do believe it, not ſo much becauſe he ſays it, as becauſe we have other evidence to ground our belief upon. For we have known very worthy Men of thoſe who were formerly called Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that have been, as much againſt Antinomian errours, as we our ſelves are. Such there are at this day, and ſuch we doubt not there will be, when we are dead, and gathered to our Fathers. If then, by <hi>his Party,</hi> our Authour mean the Reverend Brethren of that Perſwaſion aforeſaid, we neither did, nor do ſuſpect them <hi>as ſuch.</hi> But, for all that, we are ſorry, that ſome, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a Party, ſhould have alſo made themſelves to be ſuſpected at leaſt of favouring Antinomianiſm. This is the caſe of the Authour of the Letter, who raiſed ſuch a ſuſpicion in the minds of ſome that truly loved him, by <hi>recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. Criſps Book</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſays in his late Preface, and we know it to be true) and by lending it to one, without giving the leaſt caution againſt any of the errours in it. His own Conſcience knows this to be true. And this might very probably raiſe a ſuſpicion of him in particular. And we think lie was concerned to have cleared himſelf, and expected that in his Letter he would have done it, by diſowning ſome of the Doctrinal errours in the ſaid Booke. But we are diſappointed, for there we do not find that he hath ſo clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned any of the Doctrinal errours in that Book, as that the <hi>People who want judgment</hi> (as his expreſſion is) can diſcern, that he hath done it. This we ſhall endeavour to make out from ſeveral paſſages in the Letter it ſelf. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Page 10. All that he ſaith againſt that Book is this. <hi>There are many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in it that we generally diſlike.</hi> Now this he might ſafely ſay, and yet not diſown any, but in his heart believe every Doctrinal point in it.</p>
            <p>There are many precious Truths ill expreſſed by ſome very Orthodox Divines;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93177:12"/>and in ſuch a caſe, we may well ſay that we diſlike the way of expreſſion, tho' we dearly love the Truth ſo expreſſed. We find that the Reverend and pious Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in a Faſt Sermon, preached before the Houſe of Commons in the Year 1643. on <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.26. ſaith,
<note place="margin">Page 32.</note> That <hi>the Antinomian is the Golden white Devil, a Spirit of Hell cloathed with all Heaven, and the Notions of Free Grace.</hi> It ſeems the Devil of Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm did not appear white enough to our Authour in Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book; but what if he had appeared in a better and whiter Dreſs, what if the Antinomianiſm had been <hi>better expreſſed,</hi> how would the Authour of the Letter have liked it then? Truly for any thing he hath here ſaid to the contrary, he might have liked it well enough.</p>
            <p>It is true, in the end of that Paragraph he ſays, That <hi>Error is often, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, oppoſed by Error under Truths name.</hi> And we confeſs he may poſſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply one part of that paſſage unto Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book, and we would hope that he thereby meant, that indeed there are Errours in Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book; but withal we muſt ſay, that ſuch an acknowledgment of Errour to be in that Book, is too obſcure to be diſcerned by the ordinary people that <hi>want judgment,</hi> and for whoſe uſe (he ſaith) he wrote his Book; and that becauſe it is a general expreſſion, which is true enough in it ſelf, without reſpect to Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book, and whether it be applied thereunto or not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Page 26. he ſayes, <hi>We justly complain that in their oppoſing of true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian Errours, and particularly the alledged Tenents of Dr.</hi> Criſp, <hi>they hint that there is a Party of, &amp;c.</hi> Now, pray mark how warily he expreſſeth himſelf, and how tender he ſeems to be of the credit of that Book. He doth not ſay, (true Antinomian Errors, and particularly the Tenents of Dr. <hi>Criſp;</hi>) for then indeed he had plainly confeſſed, that there are true Antinomian Errours in the Book; but he only ſaith, <hi>[the alledged Tenents of that Doctor]</hi> by which Word <hi>[Alledged]</hi> he may make ſome People believe, that he never meant there were any true Antinomian Errours in that Drs. Book; but that true Antinomian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are alledged out of it by Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and others, and that very wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as Mr. <hi>Chancey</hi> pretends.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Page 24. he ſays, <hi>It is not yet called in queſtion by any, but that there is a decreed Juſtification from Eternity.</hi> Here may be another Juggle, for theſe words (there is a <hi>decreed</hi> Juſtification from Eternity) are capable of the Antinomian ſenſe, nay more, they are not fairly capable of any other ſenſe, to underſtand them properly: For a <hi>decreed</hi> Juſtification, is not the Decree it ſelf, but the object or effect of the Decree.</p>
            <p>The Decree it ſelf, is from Eternity, but the object and effect of the Decree is in time, as Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> tells us; and even common ſenſe and reaſon may aſſure us of it. For the Decree being from Eternity, and the object and effect of the Decree being after the Decree, it cannot be from Eternity too, and if it be not from Eternity, it muſt be in time. And yet the Letter ſaith, that a <hi>decreed</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (though it be the object or effect of the Decree) is from Eternity; which is the very Errour of the Antinomians, who ignorantly confound the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and effect of the Decree with the Decree it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We are ſure the Words of the Letter, bear this ſenſe; yet we will not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm that he meant them in this ſenſe, becauſe we would hope, though he hath ſaid expreſly that there is a <hi>decreed</hi> Juſtification from Eternity; that yet he onely meant, and would have ſaid that there is a <hi>Decree of Juſtification</hi> from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93177:13"/>If any now ſhould object on his behalf, and ſay, the that foreſaid words not only may, but muſt be underſtood of the Eternity of the Decree it ſelf, and cannot be underſtood of the Eternity of the decreed Juſtification, which is the effect of the Decree; becauſe of the diſtinction which follows, of a <hi>virtual</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> Juſtification: We can eaſily anſwer that if we our ſelves were true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, and durſt ſo far diſſemble, as ſometimes to ſeem not to be Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we could make the opinion of Juſtifications actual exiſtence from Eternity, conſiſt well enough with the diſtinction of vertual and actual Juſtification, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Letter. For we would underſtand it with reſpect to manifeſtation Thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Juſtification, which actually exiſted from Eternity, was virtually mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in, and by the Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is actually manifeſted, and is actual in manifeſtation, when we lay hold on, and plead Redemption in Chriſts Blood by Faith.</p>
            <p>And thus by a different uſe of Words, a Man void of the fear of God, might juggle, and at different times, and upon different occaſions might pleaſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Parties, and make them both believe that he were of their Judgment. We do not ſay, that our Authour doth ſo, only we wiſh, that he had not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf ſo ambiguouſly, but that with more plainneſs, and ſimplicity, he had declared himſelf againſt thoſe Antinomian Errours. Thus he had effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all grounds of ſuſpecting him any more, whereas, as he hath carried the matter in general doubtful expreſſions (it may be to avoid the <hi>diſpleaſure of ſome of his good Friends,</hi>) inſtead of fully clearing himſelf, he hath left ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him ſtill, that if he be not a real Antinomian, he is at leaſt a Favourer of them, and one that would keep up his Intereſt amongſt them; and therefore in ſpeaking of Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book, all that he ſayes is, that <hi>he likes not his way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf,</hi> and that there are true Antinomian Errours <hi>alledged</hi> out of it, but not that there are any really in it; as alſo he grants to the Antinomians, that there is a <hi>decreed</hi> Juſtification from Eternity, which is as much as they deſire: for decreed Juſtification is diſtinct from, and is the object and effect of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: And ſo if Juſtification, as it is the object and effect of the Decree, be from Eternity; then the Antinomians and he are agreed in that matter, and both of them hold that not onely the Decree of Juſtification (as of all other things) is from Eternity, but that Juſtification it ſelf is from Eternity. We do not ſee how Men of their Principles, can gather any other ſence from his Words: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he uſed ſuch Words <hi>on purpoſe</hi> to make them conceive good hopes of him, we ſhall neither affirm nor deny, but leave it to his own Conſcience. And as the Antinomians may hope well of him, ſo will we too, but not in their way; we will hope, that he is not for the Antinomians, but for the Truth, and for us, notwithſtanding his Ambiguous Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Now we have ſeen how well he hath cleared himſelf of the ſuſpicion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm, which he brought upon himſelf by his own Act and Deed. Let us next ſee how he hath cleared his <hi>Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have declared already that we did not ſuſpect them, much leſs accuſe them of real Antinomianiſm, and ſo they needed no clearing with reſpect to us: Yet ſince the Authour of the Letter hath told the World, that they were both ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and accuſed, and ſince he hath undertaken to vindicate them, and to clear up their innocency, let us ſee how well he hath behaved himſelf in this matter. And for this let us look into the Third Page of the Letter, where he thus writes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93177:13"/>
               <hi>As to the Party ſuſpected of Antinomianiſm and Libertiniſm (in this City,) it is plain that the Churches wherein they are concerned, are more ſtrict and exact in trying of them that offer themſelves to their Communion, as to their Faith and Holineſs before their admitting them; in the engagements laid on them to a Goſpel-walking at their admiſſion, and in their inſpection over them afterwards. As to their Converſations, they are generally of the more regular and exact frame. Is it not unaccountable to charge a People with Licentionſneſs, when the Chargers cannot deny, and ſome cannot well bear the ſtrictneſs of their walk?</hi> Then to confirm the Argument from the more than ordinary Holineſs of their Lives, he ſays that <hi>they ſincerely profeſs that their godlineſs begun with, and is promoted by the Faith of their Principles:</hi> Here we have him pleading for his Party, that he hath lately aſſociated himſelf unto, by an Argument that reflects on his old Friends, and caſts Dirt on all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> throughout the World. For the plain Engliſh of it is this, we and our Party are more Godly than you, our Churches are better conſtituted than yours, we are alſo more holy in our Lives than you, and this our Godlineſs and Holineſs begun with the Faith of our Principles; therefore it is an unaccountable thing to charge any of us with Antinomianiſm. Now though we do not charge them, yet ſince they are by ſome body charged with it, or elſe this Authour tells a great untruth; we ſhould be glad to ſee them better cleared than they are by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: For that upon which the ſtrength of this Argument depends is begged, and not proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is taken for granted, yea it is plainly enough aſſerted, that <hi>their Churches are better constituted,</hi> than ours, or than all the Presbyterian Churches throughout the World. And yet he knows that this is a thing in queſtion, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about it, is not yet decided; yea that moſt (we think) of both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions in <hi>England,</hi> have agreed to leave it undecided, as it was; and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed unto an Union without the deciſion of it. We wiſh therefore that this had not been mentioned, but ſince he hath mentioned it, and laid ſtreſs upon it; we muſt refer him unto one, of whom he hath heard, and for whom, we hope, he hath yet ſome honourable eſteem, and that is the Reverend Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Lockyer.</hi> Let him weigh well his Arguments from Page 127. to Page 168. and look forward into the Appendix, if he pleaſe.

Page 92. <hi>The Reverend and moſt Convincing Writer</hi> Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> &amp;c. If thoſe Arguments do not convince our Authour, we leave him to pleaſe himſelf a while with his new choſen Opinion; but we cannot allow it to be a good <hi>Medium</hi> whereby to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him, and his Party, from the ſuppoſed charge of Antinomianiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He takes it for granted, nay he poſitively affirms, that <hi>his Party are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more holy in their Lives.</hi> This is a very friendly Teſtimony; our Authour may poſſibly think, that he hath deſerved well of them by this: But we ſhould think them to be wiſer Men, than to eſteem him ever the better Man for ſuch a flattering like commendation of them. If an Enemy had done it, or if one leſs concerned had ſaid ſo, it would have carryed in it a better grace, and would have looked upon them with a better aſpect. For our parts, we know who it was that ſaid, <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, &amp;c.</hi> and we deſire not, to imitate ſuch; but chooſe rather to ſay with the deſpiſed Publican, <hi>God be merciful to us Sinners,</hi> Luke 18.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He takes it for granted, that Mens appearing for a time more holy than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93177:14"/>others, is ſufficient to ſecure them from falling under the juſt ſuſpicion, or real guilt of groſs and dangerous Errours. We cannot be of his mind in this;</p>

And this opinion of them was the more lifted up through the ſimplicity and weakneſs of their Followers, who would in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, tell others, that ſince the Apostles times, they were perſwaded, none ever received ſo much light from God, as ſuch and ſuch had done, naming their Leaders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>As they would lift up themſelves, ſo alſo their Opinions by gilding them over with ſpecious terms of Free Grace, Glorious Light, Goſpel-Truths, as holding forth naked Christ: And this took much with ſimple honest Hearts, that loved Christ, eſpecially with new Converts, who were lately in bondage under Sin and Weath, and had new tasted the ſweetneſs of Free Grace; being now in their first love to Christ, they were exceeding glad to embrace any thing that might further advance Christ and Free Grace; and ſo drank them in</hi> (that is their Errours) <hi>readily.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Whether our Authour deſigned to imitate them when he lent Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Book to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he knows beſt himſelf; we know nothing of his ſecret deſigns, but if he had any ſuch deſign, we are heartily glad he miſſed his mark, and deſire to bleſs God, that that worthy Perſon was ſo well ſtabliſhed in the Principles of pure Chriſtianity, as not to be moved, unleſs it were to an holy Indignation at ſome things in the foreſaid Book.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> ſays, That <hi>aſſoon as they had thus wrought in themſelves, and a good conceit of their Opinions, by all theſe ways of ſubtilty, into the Hearts of People; Nextly they strongly endeavoured with all the craft they could, to undermine the good Opinion of their Ministers, and their Doctrine, and to work them clean out of their Affections, telling them they were ſorry that their Teachers had ſo miſled them, and trained them up under a Covenant of Works, and that themſelves never having been taught of God, it is no wonder they did no better teach them the Truth, and how they might ſit till Dooms day under their Legal Sermons, and never ſee light.</hi> Our Authour ſeems to have out-done thoſe Seducers in this black Art; for in the 32d. Page of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſayes that the <hi>Divines, who differ from him, do plead that ſame cauſe, which the Devil pleads dayly in the hearts of all natural men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are weary of tranſcribing, let any, who would ſee further into this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, conſult the Book it ſelf, which is lately Reprinted: But we have made uſe of the firſt Edition. Here our Authour may ſee the force of his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93177:14"/>Argument, taken from <hi>the appearing holineſs of his Party.</hi> For our Parts, we do not preſume to cenſure his Party, we judge well of all Men, till we ſee good reaſon to alter our Judgment; and had much rather be ſevere in our Judgments upon our ſelves, than upon others: Nor do we more fear that the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches in Old <hi>England</hi> will turn Antinomian, than they did in <hi>New England.</hi> There they oppoſed Antinomianiſm, and teſtified againſt it, and we hope they will do the like here. But we cannot but think, that what hath been once, may poſſibly be again, and as ſome, that were of our Brethrens Perſwaſion there, fell fouly into groſs Antinomianiſm, after they had for a time made an high Profeſſion, and great ſhow of more than ordinary Holineſs; ſo may they do here: And therefore our Authours Argument from his Parties being (as he ſays) <hi>more holy than ours,</hi> is not (we judge) ſufficient to clear them of all ſuſpicion of inclining that way.</p>
            <p>If any, in favour to us, ſhould take the ſame Argument, (for it is a Leaden Dagger, and may be bended which way Men will,) and apply it to our Party, (as our Authour is pleaſed to diſtinguiſh us,) and go about to prove thereby that we can be in no danger of falling into Antinomianiſm, or Pelagianiſm, or any other Hereſie, nor can there be any ground to ſuſpect us, becauſe we are holier than our Brethren on the other ſide, or than any other people in <hi>England;</hi> we ſhould never thank him for his pains, but rather rebuke him for his Flattery; and adviſe him to forbear putting Fallacies and Tricks upon the people in favour of us. We think there is none of us all, on one ſide or other, how holy ſoever; but might fall for a time into as groſs Errours, as Antinomianiſm, if the Lord (to try us) ſhould leave us to our ſelves, and the Tentations of Satan, transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelf into an Angel of Light; <hi>Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leaſt he fall.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.12. Rom. 11.20.</note> And thou ſtandest by Faith, be not high-minded, but fear.</hi> We receive this advice from the Lord, and apply it to our ſelves; and we would hope that our Authour, and his Party, will do the like.</p>
            <p>And we think they have one reaſon ſo to do, that is proper and peculiar to themſelves, if they duly lay to heart how Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who went out from them, is turned aſide from the Truth, and is drawing Diſciples after him into Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm. We need ſay no more to ſhew that this part of the Vindication of his Conſorts is inſufficient to attain its end, if his end really was to vindicate them, and not rather to commend himſelf to them by commending them to the World, as the holieſt People in <hi>England.</hi> If in other parts of his Vindication, he hath had better ſucceſs, and hath done them better ſervice, we are glad of it; for we would really have them well vindicated, if they be (as he ſaith they are) ſuſpected and accuſed. We verily believe, there are good ſerious People amongſt them, that ſincerely fear God, ſuch we honour and love: And wiſh that theirs and ours were all ſuch. And where the Churches are ſaid to be ſo holy, we ſhould be glad to find that all the Miniſters were as holy, and that the Holineſs of ſome of them did more appear than it doth in our Authours Letter, or in the late Writings of ſome others. If we ſhould follow the example they have given us, in our way of Writing, we think we ſhould have no great cauſe to tell the World of our Holineſs. The God of all Grace, through Chriſt Jeſus, grant that the great and precious promiſes of the Goſpel may have a better effect upon us all, and make us more careful, and ſtudious to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93177:15"/>
            <p>We have but one thing more to ſay on this part of our Authours Vindication, and that is, Whereas he ſays pag. 3. That <hi>his Party profeſs ſincerely that their godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs begun with the Faith of their Principles:</hi> We demand <hi>what Principles</hi> he means whether the Principles of Chriſtian Religion which are common to them and us, with the other Reformed Churches, or certain Principles proper and <hi>peculiar to them,</hi> as a Party diſtinct from the reſt? If the <hi>firſt,</hi> we have nothing to gain-ſay to it; for we our ſelves do, with all our hearts, acknowledge that all the Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith the Lord hath bleſſed us, did partly begin in, and partly proceed from the lively effectual Faith of the ſame <hi>common</hi> Principles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But if our Authour mean the ſecond, to wit, That the Godlineſs of his Party begun with the Faith of certain Principles <hi>proper and peculiar to them,</hi> as a Party diſtinct from all other Societies of Chriſtians; we can by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their profeſſion in that matter. Indeed we have a better opinion of our Brethren, than to believe that they ever made any ſuch profeſſion; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, that our Authour would ever ſincerely, and heartily join with them in it, and ſo proclaim himſelf to have been an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> till of late, that he join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, in full Communion, with them. For we read in <hi>Nethenus</hi> his Preface to Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s <hi>Examen Arminianiſmi,</hi> that he was accounted a pious, godly Young Man, in the Year 1668. when he aſſiſted the ſaid <hi>Nethenus</hi> in the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of that Book of <hi>Rutherford.</hi> And though he hath lately gone off from his Principles, and we think from ſome Principles contained in that Book, both as to <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> yet we do not believe that he will even acknowledge that he hath <hi>changed his Godlineſs with his Principles,</hi> and that as he hath got <hi>new Principles,</hi> ſo he hath a <hi>new Godlineſs,</hi> and that he never had any before. If we ſhould be miſtaken in this our charitable opinion of him, we ſhould be ſorry for him, and could not but fear that he is in as bad a caſe, as he fancies the middle-way Men to be in, who <hi>uſually have a greater kindneſs</hi> (he ſays) <hi>for that extream they go half way to,
<note place="margin">Let. pag. 2.</note> than for that they go half way from.</hi> For if he ſhould be found to have made ſuch a Profeſſion, that his <hi>Godlineſs begun</hi> with the Faith of his new Principles; he is not onely gone the <hi>half,</hi> but (we think) the <hi>whole</hi> way to the extreme. And that (if it ſhould be ſo) will help us to account for his being ſo unmerciful in his cenſures, and accuſations of us, who had rather ſtop in the mid-way than to run with him into ſuch extremes.</p>
            <p>This puts us in mind of a paſſage in Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton</hi>'s little Treatiſe, in the Book of Martyrs, Vol. II. pag. 188. Col. 2. to which the Letter refers us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> and which we have read, upon our Authours recommendation. The paſſage is this, <hi>[Evil Works make not a Man evil]</hi> We hope our Authour would not have us to underſtand theſe words juſt as they ſound, without interpretation, or diſtinction. We honour the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that bleſſed Martyr of Chriſt, and are willing to underſtand his words juſt as he meant them, and as they are conſiſtent with the Truth of God; and that is thus. Evil works do not make a Man <hi>firſt evil,</hi> becauſe we are all evil by participation of the ſin of our firſt Parents from our Conception and Birth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. But for all that, we know very well, that in another ſenſe, evil works do really make a Man evil, they make him <hi>gradually evil,</hi> that is, they make him worſe than he was. If our Authour do not ſee the Truth of this at a diſtance, let him bring it home to himſelf, and then we dare ſay, he will ſee the Truth of what we affirm, That evil works will make a Man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93177:15"/>evil, that is, worſe than he was. For if not, then (1.) it muſt be either becauſe he is ſo very bad already, that he cannot poſſibly be worſe, and this, we hope, our Authour will confeſs not to be true of himſelf; or elſe (2) it muſt be, becauſe he is already ſo very good, that let him do never ſo many evil works, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him evil, that is, they cannot make him worſe than he was before he did them. Now we cannot think that he hath ſuch an Opinion of himſelf: If we knew that he had, we ſhould look upon him as a very dangerous Man to have any thing to do with; for he might do us all the miſchief he could by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſlandering, or otherwiſe, and yet be perſwaded in his own mind, that he was never a whit the worſe for ſo doing. He and we both profeſs to believe that all Gods Regenerate, Juſtified people are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation, ſo as that they do not fall from Grace, either totally, or finally.</p>
            <p>But we muſt profeſs for our ſelves, that it is none of our faith, that the Saints on Earth are already ſo confirmed in Goodneſs, that they cannot ſin at all, or if they do ſin, (as alas too ſadly they have done, and frequently do!) that their ſins do not make them evil in any degree, nor in the leaſt, worſe than they were, before they ſinned. And we hope our Authour is not ſo far gone, but that he will yet join with us in this profeſſion. For by this time (we think) he may ſee (if he did not before) the certain and evident truth of what we affirm, that evil works will make a Man evil; that is, if he be evil already, they will make him more evil, and if he be good already, they will make him leſs good, and to be leſs good than he ſhould be, is to be in ſome degree evil. See the XVIth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which our Authour, and we have all ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; as alſo the IIth. Article of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, and by both it will manifeſtly appear, that our firſt Reformers, even the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (by whom Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> through the Grace of God, was fully converted from popery, and from whom he had that paſſage, that evil works do not make a Man evil) never thought that a good Man cannot do any evil works, or that if any Man, good or evil, do evil Works, they will not make him evil, that is, worſe than he was before he did them. In all this we do not in the leaſt contradict the true ſenſe of the bleſſed Martyr Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> but explain his Words, and give the true ſenſe of them, as will appear to any Man of Judgment, that will be at the pains to read attentively what he ſays before, and after the Words we are upon. We ſhould not have mentioned this, but that we are afraid leſt ignorant, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious people (unto whom our Authour recommends that little Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Hamiltons</hi>) ſhould wreſt the Words of a Holy Martyr, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encourage Libertiniſm;
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note> as they do wreſt the ſacred Words of the moſt Holy God himſelf, unto their own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>We do not by this reflect in the leaſt upon the ſaid Martyr of Bleſſed Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but rather endeavour (as we are bound) to ſecure his good Name from any Reproach, which the Enemies of our Religion might poſſibly caſt upon it, from a wrong, and wreſted ſenſe of his Words, as they are alwayes ready to do. This we have here provided againſt, by giving the true ſenſe of his Words, which being rightly underſtood have nothing harſh in them at all; but otherwiſe taken, juſt according to the ſound of the Letter, they carry a very ſcandalous meaning, which we dare ſay the Holy Martyr never thought of. We do not doubt therefore, but our Authour will confeſs, that we have done right to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, and have rightly interpreted his ſaying, which he learned of <hi>Luther.</hi> But if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93177:16"/>we happen to be miſtaken as to our Authour, and he will not admit this ſenſe we have given of the foreſaid words, then he cannot be juſtly offended; if this be given as his Character, the Authour of the Letter, is one who holds, that no Man can make himſelf evil by doing evil, that is, he holds that no Man by doing all the evil, and miſchief, that he is able to do, can make himſelf, in the leaſt degree, worſe than he was. And then let the World Judge, how well he hath cleared himſelf of the ſuſpicion of Antinomianiſm, which he had brought upon himſelf. But we are really perſwaded better things of our Authour, though we thus write upon a ſuppoſition, which we hope he will never admit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than admit ſuch a ſuppoſition with its neceſſary conſequence, he will join with us, and ſay, that <hi>Luther</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> meant no more, but that evil works do not firſt make a Man evil, becauſe ever ſince the firſt Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> all meer Men, beſides them two, are evil by Original ſin, before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Actual Sin. Thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſaid of the Occaſion and Deſign of the Letter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Firſt Error againſt our Chriſtian Faith, which we find in the Letter, is that there is no <hi>new Law of Grace,</hi> according to which the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth unto his People the Benefits and Bleſſings of Juſtification and Eternal Savlation. That we do not wrong him in charging him with this errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinion, is evident from his Letter, pag. 9, 18, 29. and pag. 30, 31. <hi>Where he ſaith, that Justification, upon the terms of the new Law of Grace, doth not agree with the ſound Words of the Reverend Aſſembly of Divines at</hi> Weſtminſter; <hi>and that the new Law of Grace is a new word, but of an old and ill meaning.</hi> Thus he. And this the people muſt believe, upon his bare word, without any proof.</p>
               <p>Now to refute this, we need do no more, but refer them, that deſire to know who is in the right, as to this matter, unto Mr. <hi>Williams defence of Goſpel truth,</hi> from pag. 18, to 34. where it is ſufficiently proved by Scripture, by reaſon grounded on Scripture, and by the Teſtimony of Divines of the Reformed Churches, That there is a new Law of Grace, that the Goſpel is that Law of Grace, and that it is a new Law of Grace in the ſame ſenſe that the Covenant of the Goſpel is a new Covenant of Grace. This Error then (that there is no new Law of Grace) being refuted to our hand, we might well paſs it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another. Yet becauſe the Authour diſcovers ſo much <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in what he ſays to the People, upon this point, we judge it expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93177:16"/>
               <p>And becauſe he would make the people believe (whether he believe it of us, himſelf; God and his own Conſcience know) that we conſider God <hi>only</hi> as a Rector, ruling by a preſcribed Law, in all his Purpoſes concerning and Dealings with the Children of Men, That he may not go on deceiving and being deceived; We declare to the World, that we never thought, ſpoke, or wrote any ſuch thing, as he would faſten upon us, that he may the better miſrepreſent us to the people, pag. 9. at the beginning, to wit, that <hi>God is only to be conſidered under the notion of a Rector and Judge,</hi> as aforeſaid. Where by the way, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice, how honeſtly he deals by our Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> in drawing this inference from a pretended Scheme of his Doctrine, [<hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith our Authour) <hi>they antedate the Laſt Day, and hold forth Chriſt as a Judge, rather than a Saviour.</hi>] Here the World ſees what Doctrine he fixes upon Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> Next, Let them turn to pag. 56. of <hi>Goſpel Truth ſtated, &amp;c.</hi> and there they will find theſe expreſs words of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> [<hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>treats with men as his Subjects, whom he will now Rule, and hereafter Judge:</hi>] Now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Chriſt be our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but by ceaſing to be our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and cannot we be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, but by ceaſing to be ſubject to him? Where is that Man's Brains, who cannot ſee, if he will, that theſe two things do very well conſiſt, that Chriſt is both our Saviour and Ruler, at the ſame time? But this only on the by.</p>
               <p>We declare therefore again, that we never thought, ſpoke, or wrote, that God is to be conſidered <hi>only</hi> under the notion of a Rector, or Judge in all his Purpoſes concerning and Dealings with the Race of Man-kind. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we believe, that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> God, as an abſolute Soveraign Lord, of his own moſt Free and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Will and Pleaſure, purpoſed to give, and accordingly gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son to be the Redeemer, and Saviour of ſinful Men, but not of fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God as an abſolute Soveraign Lord, of his own good pleaſure, and according to the Counſel of his own will, did before the foundation of the World, chooſe ſome, and not others, of the lapſed, and loſt Race of Man-kind, unto the participation of Special, Effectual, Victorious Grace, and Eternal Glory, through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in the firſt making of the Covenant, and enacting of the Law of Grace with us, through Chriſt Jeſus, God did not act as a Governour Ruling us according to an external Law, which he had before made for us, but as a Soveraign, and gracious Lord, who had freely purpoſed to ſave us in ſuch a way by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in giving the foreſaid Special, Effectual, Victorious Grace to the Elect, rather than to others, God doth not act as a Rector, or Governour, according to a ſtated Law preſcribed to us, and known by us; but according to the counſel of his own. Will, and his hidden Purpoſes and Tranſactions with Chriſt concerning us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But yet, in good conſiſtency with what we have ſaid, we do firmly believe, that God hath enacted; and conſtituted a Law of Grace, for beſtowing upon us the ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits of the Covenant, ſuch as Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Glorification.</p>
               <p>This Law God hath revealed to us in the Scriptures of Truth, by this Law he both obliges, and encourages us; to certain Duties; and alſo, by the promiſes of it, obliges himſelf to Juſtifie and glorifie us for Chriſts ſake, if we perform
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93177:17"/>the Duties preſcribed, and comply with the Terms injoined. It is with reſpect to thoſe ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits of the Covenant, that we ſay, the Lord deals with us as a Rector, and Governour, Ruling us by a Law of Grace.</p>

               <p>This is that which we mean by the Law of Grace, and our meaning is ſo plain, that any Man endued with common ſenſe, and reaſon, may underſtand it. But our Brethren do not like the thing it ſelf. And why, we pray, do not they like it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it becauſe it is called a <hi>Law?</hi> Why the Scriptures of Truth call it ſo expreſly, Rom. 3.27. <hi>the law of faith.</hi> Gal. 6.2. <hi>the law of Chriſt.</hi> The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's Law; <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> Iſa. 42.4. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it becauſe it obligeth to <hi>duty with a promiſe of bleſſing</hi> to the Performers, and with a <hi>threatening</hi> of miſery and puniſhment to the Neglecters, Refuſers and Deſpiſers? If this be the reaſon wherefore they like it not, then let them receive an Anſwer from the Lords own Mouth; Luke 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> But we have better hopes of our Brethren. Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it becauſe we call it a Law of Grace? Why we call it a Law of Grace, becauſe it really is ſo, it is a gracious Law: For it is a Federal, or Covenant-Law, that makes rich Offers of Grace, of Juſtifying and Glorifying Grace; and it is a means alſo whereby the Lord conveys unto his People regenerating and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, it is a means which the Lord hath ordained to bring his People to Faith, Repentance, and Goſpel-obedience: Therefore it may well be called a Law of <hi>Grace.</hi> And we think none ſhould, and eſpecially our Angry Brethren, ſhould not like it the worſe, becauſe we call it, and it really is a Law of Grace: They do not like the Covenant of the Goſpel the worſe, becauſe it is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> and why then ſhould they like this Law of Chriſt, the worſe, becauſe we call it the <hi>Law of Grace?</hi> eſpecially when we tell them, that this Law of Grace is the conditional part of the Covenant of Grace, it is that part of the Covenant of Grace, which reſpects the way of God's diſpenſing to us the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Bleſſings and Benefits of the Covenant, ſuch as pardon of ſin; and eternal Salvation. And doth not the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. ſay expreſly, that <hi>it is of faith, that it might be by grace.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, Is it becauſe we call it a <hi>new</hi> Law? If that be it that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, why ſhould our Brethren be diſpleaſed on that account, ſince they know (if it be not their own fault) that we call it the <hi>new</hi> Law in no other ſenſe, than as we call the Covenant of Grace, the <hi>new Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Law of Grace we ſpeak of, is both <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old</hi> in different reſpects; It is <hi>new</hi> in reſpect of the Covenant of Works made with Man in his ſtate of innocency: For that Covenant of Works was before this Law of Grace which came after, and therefore is comparatively new. Again, as we Chriſtians have it, it is called <hi>new,</hi> becauſe we have the neweſt, and cleareſt and laſt edition of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93177:17"/>it. And as in theſe reſpects it is <hi>new,</hi> ſo in other reſpects it is <hi>old;</hi> It is old as the ſubſtance of it hath had an exiſtence in the Church of God, ever ſince the firſt promiſe of Grace made to our firſt Parents after the fall. It is the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi>

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27, 28, 29.</note> which hath been in the Church under <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> forms of adminiſtration, and will continue, in us neweſt and excellenteſt form unto the end of the World. We hear it is ſaid by ſome, that the Command to believe and repent, with the promiſe of pardon to the penitent Believer; and the threatening of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the impenitent Unbeliever, cannot be an Evangelical <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe God doth not give unto all, ſpecial grace to enable them to believe and repent in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Command. We anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If that be it that hinders it from being a Law, then notwithſtanding that reaſon, it is a Law to all Gods Elect, for to them he gives, through Chriſt, the ſaid ſpecial Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny the Conſequence, God gives not ſpecial Grace to the Non-elect therefore the Command to believe and repent, with the annexed conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon, and threatening of puniſhment, cannot be a Law to them. It may be, and is a Law to them, though the ſaid ſpecial Grace is not given them. And whereas it is objected, that without ſuch ſpecial Grace the Non-elect cannot obey that Law. We Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That their <hi>cannot,</hi> their Impotence is not <hi>phyſical,</hi> but <hi>moral,</hi> they <hi>cannot</hi> be cauſe they <hi>will not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Non-elect, to whom the Evangelical Law is <hi>promulgated</hi> together with it receive more Common-Grace, more light and power from the Lord, in order to their obeying his revealed Will, than they make a good uſe of. Hence the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in their <hi>Synopſis of purer Divinity,</hi> write thus concerning this matter, <hi>Diligenter notandum eſt,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Diſp. 24. Theſ. 54, 55. p. 290, 291.</note> 
                  <hi>It is diligently to be noted, that this Non-election doth not take away, or deny; all Grace in the Non-elect, but only that Grace which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Elect.

But this adminiſtration of common providence, always hath conjoined with it that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Benefits external and internal; which in perfect of innocent nature was indeed ſufficient to Salvation, as it is manifeſt in the reprobate Angels, and in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, conſidered in our firſt Parents before the Fall; But in corrupt Nature ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, or is ſuperadded to nature under the Goſpel, that they are bereft and deprived of all pretence of excuſe before the Divine Judgment, as the Apoſtle teſtifies,</hi> Acts 14.17. Rom. 1.20. &amp; 2.1. John 15.22.— <hi>and elſe-where.</hi> Thus the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Diſcourſe <hi>concerning the Holy Spirit,</hi> Page 198. ſayes, That <hi>where ſpecial Grace and real Converſion is not attained</hi> (to wit by means of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace,</hi> of which he is there writing,) <hi>it is always from the interpoſition of an act of wilfulneſs, and ſtubbornneſs, in thoſe enlightened and convicted. They do not ſincerely improve what they have received, and faint not mierly for want of ſtrength to proceed, but by a free act of their own Wills, they refuſe the Grace which is further tendered unto them in the Goſpel.</hi> So much briefly, in anſwer to the foreſaid Objection;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93177:18"/>which was caſt into our way; and it being removed, we go on with our Author, who in Pag. 30. ſaith, That <hi>[New Law of Grace is a new Word, but of an old and ill meaning:]</hi> Very well! Here is a pretty Jingle of Words, and it may be he, or ſome that he knows, are much pleaſed with ſuch Trifles; and if ſo, here they are fitted. For our parts, we cannot ſee what ſhould move him to ſay, that the new Law of Grace is a new Word, of an old and ill meaning, but that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himſelf was much pleaſed with the Jingle, or elſe (which we rather think) he intended to pleaſe ſome of his Conſorts, and to make them remember the thing for the ſake of the little wit he had ſhewed in expreſſing it. And if that was his intended end, it is pity he ſhould fail of obtaining it, and that People ſhould not remember it for ever, for that reaſon (which will for ever hold true) that there was little wit in it. But you will ſay, How doth that appear? Why very plainly thus, There is little Wit, and leſs Grace, in boldly aſſerting a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Falſehood, in matter of Fact, in the Face of a learned Age. But this the Author of the Letter hath done, in aſſerting, that <hi>new Law of Grace is a new Word of an old, but ill meaning.</hi> To prove this, it being matter of Fact, there needs no more, but to ſhew from the Teſtimony of credible Witneſſes, who lived many Hundred Years agoe, that the Words are not new, but were uſed in the Chriſtian Church in a good ſenſe and meaning long before we were born. Without doubt we might bring Multitudes of Witneſſes, from among the Antient Writers of the Church, to prove this matter of Fact, if it were needful; but we ſhall content our ſelves with a few, whereof ſome are ſuch as our Authour cannot in reaſon except againſt, becauſe he himſelf hath ſuborned them to bear witneſs (and that falſe witneſs too) for him, againſt us.</p>
               <p>We have ſhewed already that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly calls it, <hi>the law of faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27. And ſays that <hi>it is of faith, that it might be by grace, Rom.</hi> 4.16. And that is as much as if he had ſaid, both together in one place, that it is the Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>We will paſs the Teſtimony of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> though in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> he expreſly mentions the Law of Chriſt; becauſe it is diſputed that his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, even thoſe of beſt credit, have been much interpolated and corrupted: And our cauſe needs not the Teſtimony of ſuſpected Witneſſes. Therefore after Bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi>

But now,— for I have read, O</hi> Trypho, <hi>that there ſhall be a latter or after-law, and a Teſtament, or Govenant, of the greateſt, or moſt excellent Authority of all, which Teſtament, or Covenant, now all men muſt keep, whoſoever they be, that would obtain poſſeſſion of the inheritance of God. For the Law that was given in</hi> Horeb, <hi>is now old, and concerns you</hi> Jews <hi>only; but this after law concerns all men, abſolutely and univerſally. And when one Law is ſet against another Law, the latter diſanuls the former.</hi> Again, in the ſame Page, <hi>Justin</hi> ſaith,

<note place="margin">Pag. 231. Pag. 251.</note> that this is the New Law.</hi> Afterwards he calls Chriſt the <hi>New Law giver.</hi> And he ſayes, <hi>Ye Jews deceive your ſelves by equivocal Words or Speeches, for where the Law of the Lord is ſaid, to be faultleſs, ye expound it not, of that Law which was to come after, but of the Law given by</hi> Moſes,

               </p>
               <p>Again, In the firſt of his Three Books of <hi>Testimonies against the Jews,</hi> to <hi>Quirinus.</hi> His 10th. Chapter is, <hi>Quod Lex nova dari haberet,</hi> that a new Law was to be given;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. Tom.</hi> 2. pag. 201.202.</note> which he proves by theſe Teſtimonies of Holy Scripture, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. His 11th. Chapter is, <hi>Quod diſpoſitio alia &amp; Testamentum novum dari haberet; that another administration, and a new Testament, or Covenant, was to be given;</hi> which he proves from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>His 13th. Chapter is, <hi>Quod jugum vetus evacuaretur, &amp; jugum novum daretur,</hi> that the <hi>old yoke ſhould be made null and void, and that a new yoke ſhould be given;</hi> which he proves from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, cited out of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Works, manifeſtly ſhew, that as he expreſly called the Goſpel a Law, and a new Law, ſo he held it to be a Law of Grace: For he ſays, that though it be a new yoke laid upon us, yet it is a light yoke, and an eaſie burden.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Cyprian,</hi> his Countrey-man <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that famous Light of the Chriſtian Church in <hi>Africa,</hi> ſhall appear to give in his Teſtimony to the foreſaid matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Thus then he writes in the 18th. Chapter of his Book, concerning Grace and Free-will, <hi>Haec praecepta charitatis inaniter darentur hominibus,
<note place="margin">Lib. de <hi>Grat.</hi> &amp; Lib. <hi>Arbit.</hi> cap. 18.</note> non habentibus liberum arbitrium: Sed quia per legem dantur &amp; veterem &amp; novam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe Commandements of Love (ſaith</hi> Auguſtin) <hi>would be given in vain to Men, if they had not free will: But becauſe they are given both by the old and new Law, (although the Grace is come in the new, which was promiſed in the old, but the Law without Grace is a killing Letter, whereas in (or with) Grace, it is a quickening ſpirit) whence is in men the love of God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but from God himſelf?</hi> This paſſage out of <hi>Augustin</hi> we have faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and truly tranſlated. Now it is well known, that <hi>Augustin</hi> lived, and dyed, above Twelve Hundred Years agoe; and he ſaith expreſly, that the Law of Chriſt, which we are under, is the <hi>New Law,</hi> and he proves this new Law to be a <hi>Law of Grace.</hi> So that <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> is ſo far from being a <hi>new Word of an old, but ill meaning,</hi> that it is a conſiderable time above 1200 hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Years agoe, ſince the Learned and Holy <hi>Auguſtin</hi> uſed the Word in a very good ſence, and meaning. Again, the ſame Father, in his Book to <hi>Marcellinus, de Spiritu &amp; Litera,</hi> Cap. 14. ſaith,
<note place="margin">De Spiritu &amp; Lit. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Letter of the Law forbidding Sin, doth not justifie any Man, but rather kills him by increaſing Concupiſcence, and accumulating Iniquity through prevarication: (Niſi liberet Gratia per legem fidei, quae est in Christo Jeſu) <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſt Grace deliver him, or ſet him free by the Law of Faith, which is in Christ Jeſus.</hi> Here again. <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, that we are freed from death by a <hi>Law,</hi> that that Law is the <hi>Law of Faith;</hi> that that Law of Faith is a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> for by that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93177:19"/>Law, Grace frees us from death: And he likewiſe gives us plainly to underſtand; that that gracious Law, is a <hi>new Law,</hi> for he ſays it is the Law of Faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Now it is clear, that the Law of Faith in Chriſt already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Fleſh, crucified, dead and buried, raiſed from the Dead; Glorified, and appointed to be Lord of all, and Judge of Quick and Dead; made perfect, and become the Authour of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him: muſt needs be a <hi>New Law,</hi> if we compare it with any Law that went before it. For before the coming of Chriſt, no Man was or could be, obliged to believe in him, as already Incarnate, Crucified and Glorified; otherwiſe Men had been obliged to believe a falſehood.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By this Paſſage it is as clear as the light, that <hi>Bradwardin</hi> held, that the

               <p>From the premiſſes it is clear, that above 300 Years agoe, the <hi>profound Doctor Bradwardin</hi> expreſly affirmed the Law of Chriſt to be a poſitive new Law, with a Sanction of Reward and Puniſhment; and the Scope of his Book is to prove it to be a Law of Grace. And by all this, we think the World may now ſee, that the Authour of the Letter told a great untruth, when he affirmed, that <hi>The new Law of Grace, is a new Word, but of an old, and ill meaning;</hi> and hence alſo People may learn what credit to give unto the Word of that Man.</p>
               <p>From Fathers, and Antient Writers, we will come lower down, and ſee what ſome of our <hi>Modern</hi> Divines, ſince the Reformation, have ſaid in this cauſe; and firſt, when we look abroad, we find that the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in their <hi>Synopſis of purer Divinity,</hi> ſay expreſly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſp.</hi> 22. <hi>Theſi.</hi> 32.</note> That <hi>Evangelium aliquando legis titulo inſignitur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Goſpel is ſometimes called a Law, becauſe it alſo hath its own Commandments, and its own Promiſes and Threatenings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find alſo, that the learned <hi>Gomarus,</hi> not only allows the Goſpel to be called the Law of Grace, but likewiſe gives the reaſon why it is ſo called, in theſe Words, — <hi>Beneficii ratione, Evangelium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

And truly this was excellently ſaid by <hi>Gomatus:</hi> No Man (we think) can give a better account, why the Goſpel is called the Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>And next when we look homewards again, and caſt our eyes upon our own <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Divines, we find the greateſt of them clearly of the ſame mind, that the Goſpel is a Law, in the ſenſe before explained, it is the New Law of Grace. We will inſtance in two only at preſent. The firſt is Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> no <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhop, (ſuch as <hi>Bradwardin</hi> was, whom our Authour quotes with ſuch an <hi>Elogium,</hi> againſt us) but a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhop, and a <hi>zealous</hi> Proteſtant, who held <hi>Rome to be Myſtical Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as appears from what he wrote in <hi>Tortura Torti.</hi> pag. 183, 184, 185, 186, 187.</p>
               <p>Now this zealous Proteſtant, in his 17th. Sermon of the Nativity, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. writes thus, [<hi>We had well hoped Chriſt would have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched no Law; all Goſpel, he.
<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Andrews</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Sermons. <hi>pag.</hi> 161.</note> That he would have preached down the old Law, but not have preached up any new. We ſee it is otherwiſe. A Law he hath to preach, and preach it he will: He ſaith himſelf,</hi> Praedicabo Legem. <hi>So if we will be his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, he tells us plainly we muſt receive a Law from his mouth. If we love not to hear of a Law; we muſt go to ſome other Church: For in Chriſts Church (there) a Law is preached. Chriſt began, we muſt follow, and ſay, every one of us, (as he ſaith,)</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicabo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93177:20"/>Legem. <hi>Chriſt will preach a Law, and they that are not for the Law, are not for Chriſt. It was their quarrel above, (at the</hi> 3d. <hi>verſe) they would none of Chriſt, for this very cauſe, that Chriſt comes preaching a Law, and they would live lawleſs: They would endure no Yoke, that were the Sons</hi> of Belial. Belial <hi>(that is) No Yoke. But what agreement hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial? 2 Cor. 6.15. —<hi>The very Goſpel hath her Law. A Law Evangelical there is, which Chriſt preached: And as he did, we to do the like. — look but into the grand Commiſſion (by which we all preach.) which Chriſt gave at his going out of the World. Goe (ſaith he,</hi> Mar. 28.19.) <hi>preach the Goſpel to all Nations, teaching them, what? to obſerve the things that I have commanded you. Lo, here is commanding, and here is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<note place="margin">Page 162.</note> So the Goſpel conſiſts not only of certain Articles to be believed, but of certain Commandments, and they to be obſerved. Now (I know not how) but we are fallen clean from the term (Law;) nay we are even fallen out with it: Nothing but Goſpel now. The name of Law we look ſtrangely at: we ſhun it in our common talk. To this it is come, while men ſeek to live as they liſt. Preach them Goſpel as much as ye will: but (hear ye) no Law to be preached, to hold or keep them in. And we have Goſpelled it ſo long, that the Chriſtian Law is clean gone with us. —I ſpeak it to this end, to have the one term retained as well as the other, to have neither term aboliſhed; but with equal regard both kept on foot. They are not ſo well adviſed, that ſeek to ſuppreſs either name. If the name once be loſt, the thing it ſelf will not long ſtay, but go after it, and be loſt too. — The Chriſtian Religion, in the very beſt times of it, was called</hi> Chriſtiana Lex, <hi>the Chriſtian Law; — And all the Antient Fathers liked the term well; and took it upon them. To conclude, Goſpel it how you will, if the Goſpel have not the Legalia of it acknowledged, allowed, and preſerved to it; if once it loſe the force and vigour of a Law: it is a ſign it declines, it grows weak and unprofitable, and that is a ſign it will not long laſt.</hi>

               <p>And Page 165. he ſaith, (1.) <hi>There is the benefit of this Law, what he doth for us.</hi> (2.) <hi>And then what we are to do for him, our duty out of this Law. The benefit is the Goſpel of this Law, the duty is the Law of this Goſpel.</hi> And Page 166, <hi>They ſpeak of Laws of Grace; this is indeed a Law of Grace; nay it is</hi> the Law of Grace: <hi>not only as it is oppoſite to the Law of Nature, but even becauſe it offereth Grace, the greateſt Grace that ever was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was Printed and Publiſhed in the Year 1624. and that vvas before moſt of us vvere born. And yet even then the Goſpel vvas expreſly called, the Nevv Lavv of Grace, by Biſhop <hi>Andrews;</hi> and therefore it is no nevv Word, vvhich we have lately invented. And not onely Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> vvho vvas every vvhit as expert as our Authour can be, in making a <hi>jingling noiſe</hi> vvith Words, vvhich vvas more in faſhion then, than it is novv; but the famous Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> vvho vvas uſed to a Scholaſtick cloſe way of reaſoning, both ſays, and proves that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a Lavv.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ſhall be our laſt Witneſs in this Cauſe. Novv in his Anſvver to an Arminian Book called <hi>The Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles <hi>reduced to practice,</hi> he plainly aſſerts, as we do, that God deals with Men not meerly as an abſolute Soveraign arbitrary Lord, but as a Ruler and Governour, according to a known Law in giving unto them, or with-holding from them, the ſubſequent bleſſings and benefits, of the new Covenant. His Words are theſe [<hi>Now like as the act of God's decree,
<note place="margin">Pag. 40.41, 42.</note> is of the meer pleaſure of God, no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thing being fit to be the cauſe of the eternal decree of God; in like ſort the giving of Faith and Repentance proceeds meerly of the good
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93177:20"/>pleaſure of God. According to that, God hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> Rom. 9.18. <hi>And to obtain mercy at the hand of God, is to obtain faith,</hi> Rom. 11.30. <hi>But as for Glory and Salvation, we do not ſay that God in conferring it, proceeds according to the meer pleaſure of his will; but according to</hi> a Law, <hi>which is this</hi> (whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved;) <hi>which Law, we willingly profeſs, he made according to the meer pleaſure of his will, but having made ſuch a Law, he proceeds according to it. No ſuch Law hath he made, according whereunto to proceed in the diſpenſation of the grace of Faith and Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the Dr. there diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>denyal of Special Grace, of Faith, and Repentance,</hi> and the <hi>denyal of Glory.</hi> As for the firſt, the denyal of <hi>Special Grace</hi> to ſome, when God gives it to others, the Doctor ſays, that God proceeds therein according to the meer pleaſure of his Will; but as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, his own Words are theſe, [<hi>As touching the denyal of Glory, and inflicting damnation, God doth not proceed according to the meer pleaſure of his will, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Law, which is this,</hi> (Whoſoever believeth not; ſhall be damned.) <hi>And albeit God made that Law, according to the meer pleaſure of his will; yet no wiſe man will ſay, that he denies glory, and inflicts damnation on men according to the meer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will: The caſe being clear, that God denies the one, and inflicts the other, meerly for their ſins, who are thus dealt withal.</hi> — And in the next Page [<hi>Like as God inflicts not damnation, but by way of puniſhment, ſo he doth not beſtow Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on any of ripe Years, but by way of reward. Yet here alſo is a difference, for damnation is inflicted by way of puniſhment for the evil works ſake which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but Salvation is not conferred by way of Reward, for the good works ſake, which are performed, but meerly for Chriſts ſake.</hi> Thus the Doctor in that Book.</p>
               <p>And that you may ſee, that this Paſſage did not drop inconſiderately from his Pen, we will ſhew from another Book, which he wrote afterwards, that this was his <hi>ſettled judgment,</hi> and that he was firmly, and fully perſwaded of this great Goſpel-truth. It is Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi>'s Book, called <hi>God's Love to Mankind.
<note place="margin">Pag. 37.38.</note> [As touching the conferring of Glory, God doth not beſtow this on whom he will, finding men equal without any moving cauſe thereunto, even in man; for though there be no moving cauſe thereunto in man, of its own nature; yet there is to be found a moving cauſe in man, by conſtitution Divine, whereby God is, as it were, moved to beſtow Salvation on ſome, and not on others. For God hath made a gracious promiſe,</hi> that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and repenteth, and continueth in Faith and repentance unto death; ſhall be ſaved; and whoſoever believeth not, and repenteth not, ſhall be damned. <hi>So then, though Men are equal in original ſin, and in natural corruption, and God beſtows faith and repentance on whom of them he will, curing their corruption in whom he will; yet when he comes to the conferring of Glory, men are not found equal in moral condition; and accordingly God cannot be ſaid in like manner, to beſtow Glory and Salvation on whom he will. For he hath tyed himſelf by his own conſtitution to beſtow Salvation on none, but ſuch as dye in the state of Grace. Yet I confeſs, ſome ſay that God bestows Salvation on whom he will, inaſmuch as he is the Authour of their faith and repentance, and beſtows theſe graces on whom he will: Yet certainly there is a different manner in the uſe of this Phraſe of beſtowing this, or that, on whom he will. For when God bestows Faith and Repentance, he finds them on whom he will bestow it, no better than others: but when he comes to the beſtowing of Glory, he finds them, on whom he beſtows that, far better than others.</hi> —And a little after, [<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hardneth whom he will, by denying unto them, the grace of Faith
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93177:21"/>and Repentance; yet notwithſtanding, like as it is juſt with God, to inflict damnasion upon them, for that ſin, whether original or actual, wherein he finds them when the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word is offered them: So likewiſe it cannot be denyed to be juſt with God, to leave their infidelity and impenitence wherein he finds them, uncured. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath not made any ſuch conſtitution, namely, that whoſoever is found in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and impenitence, ſhall be ſo left and abandoned by him: Therefore he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid, as to cure it in whom he will, ſo to leave it unoured in whom he will, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all equal in original Sin, and conſequently lying equally in this their natural infidelity and impenitence. So we may juſtly ſay, there is no cauſe at all, in man of this difference, to wit, why God cures infidelity and impenitency in one, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it is the meer pleaſure of God, that is the cauſe of this difference. — But</hi> (2.) <hi>as touching the denyal of Glory, and inflicting of damnation, which is the ſecond thing decreed in reprobation, there is always found a cauſe motive, yea and meritorious hereof, to wit, both of the denyal of the one, and inflicting of the other: And God doth not proceed herein according to the meer pleaſure of his will, and that by reaſon of his own conſtitution, having ordained that whoſoever continueth finally in infidelity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane courſes, and impenitency, ſhall be damned. And albeit on the other ſide it may be ſaid, in ſome ſenſe, (as I formerly ſhewed) that God ſaves whom he will, in as much as he is the Authour of Faith, which he beſtows on whom he will; yet in no congruous ſenſe can he be ſaid to damn whom he will, for as much as he is not the Authour of ſin, as he is the Authour of Faith. For every good thing he works, but ſin and the evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he only permits, not cauſeth. And laſtly, as God doth not damn whom he will, but thoſe onely whom he finds finally to have perſevered in ſin without repentance: So neither did he decree to damn, or reprobate to damnation whom he will, but onely thoſe who ſhould be found finally to perſevere in ſin without repentance.</hi>

               <p>Again in the ſame Book, pag. 106. <hi>But I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Twiſs</hi>) <hi>ſhall tell you the chief Flouriſh whereupon this Authour (and uſually the Arminians) doth inſiſt in this his looſe Argumentation, I conceive it to be this; they hope their credulous Readers, unexpert in diſtinguiſhing between God's eternal decree, and the temporal execution thereof, will be apt hereupon to conceit, that we maintain that God doth not onely of meer pleaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree whatſoever he decreeth; but alſo that he doth decree, of meer pleaſure to damn men: Which yet is utterly contrary (if I be not deceived) to the Tenet of all our Divines: All concurring in this, that God in the execution of the decree of damnation proceeds according to a Law, and not in the execution of reprobation onely, but alſo in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of election; and the Law is this,</hi> Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes not ſhall be damned; <hi>and like as he inflicteth not damnation, but by way of puniſhment, ſo he confers not ſalvation but by way of Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, pag. 184. <hi>[God hath not wiſhed, but ordained, and made it a poſitive Law; that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved, and here hence it followeth that if all, and every Man, from the beginning of the World to the end, ſhall believe in Chriſt, all and every one of them, ſhall be ſaved]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Pag. 229. <hi>[As for Salvation, that is appointed to be beſtowed, only by way of Reward of foregoing Faith, Repentance, and good works.</hi> — And a little after in the ſame Page, <hi>[Indeed our profeſſion is, that Gods purpoſe is to beſtow Salvation by way of Reward of Faith, Repentance and good works: And accordingly there is No other aſſurance of election, than by Faith and Holineſs,</hi>

               <p>But now, it may be, our Authour will object that in all this, Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſpeaks only of a Law according to which God proceeds in beſtowing, or not beſtowing eternal <hi>life and glory</hi> upon Men, but not of a Law, according to which he <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and pardons</hi> men. We Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reaſon of that was, becauſe the Doctor's Adverſaries gave him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak there of God's Law, according to which he glorifies, or damns men eternally, and not of the Goſpel-law, according to which he either juſtifies, or not juſtifies Men. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, that the Doctor's Judgment was the ſame as to both, to wit, as to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as well as to <hi>Glorification,</hi> and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe in his Anſwer to the foreſaid <hi>Arminian</hi> Book, called <hi>The Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles <hi>reduced to Practice,</hi> Pag. 16. theſe are his expreſs Words, [<hi>We ſay that</hi> Pardon of Sin, <hi>and</hi> Salvation, of Souls, <hi>are benefits purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, to be enjoyed by men, but how? not abſolutely, but conditionally, to wit, in caſe, and onely in caſe, they believe.</hi>] And Pag. 28. <hi>[Men are called upon to believe, and promiſed that upon their Faith, they ſhall obtain the grace of remiſſion of ſins and Salvation; and theſe graces may be ſaid to be offered unto all upon condition of Faith.]</hi> And Pag. 189. <hi>The Promiſes aſſured by Baptiſm, according to the Rule of Gods word, I find to be of two ſorts: Some are of benefits procured unto us by Chriſt, which are to be conferred on us conditionally;</hi> — they of this firſt ſort are <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> And Pag. 190. <hi>Juſtification and Salvation is promiſed in the Word, and aſſured in the Sacraments upon performance of a condition on mans part.

               </p>
               <p>And in his other Book againſt <hi>Hoard,</hi> [<hi>Some Benefits</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>are beſtowed upon man only conditionally (though for Chriſts ſake,) and they are the pardon of ſin, and ſalvation of the Soul,

               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies of Holy Writ do as certainly, and evidently ſhew, that God proceeds according to a ſtated Rule, and <hi>ſtanding Law</hi> of his own making, in Juſtifying, or not Juſtifying Men: as any other Teſtimonies do ſhew, that he proceeds according to a ſtated Rule, and <hi>ſtanding Law,</hi> in Glorifying, or not Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Men.</p>

               <p>And further upon that Principle, that there is no ſuch <hi>stated Rule, and known ſtanding Law,</hi> according to vvhich, God hath aſſured us, that he vvill either give eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; or inflict eternal death: We chalenge our Authour to ſhevv us, hovv in an ordinary vvay, vvithout a Miracle, the dying diſconſolate Man can be aſſured by Faith that God, for Chriſts ſake, will give eternal life to him in particular, and not inflict upon him eternal death for his Sins. For if God have not revealed in his vvritten Word, to Men, that through Chriſt he vvill give eternal life unto all penitent Believers, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to that dying Man in particular, if he be really a true penitent Believer: We ſay, if God hath not revealed this in his vvritten Word, but kept it ſecret vvithin himſelf, as a thing vvhich he vvill give <hi>arbitrarily</hi> as he pleaſeth, without regard to any ſtated Rule, or knovvn Lavv; hovv is it poſſible for the poor dying Man, vvithout an immediate extraordinary Revelation, to knovv but that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, vvhich he knovvs he hath deſerved, and not eternal life, vvhich he cannot poſſibly deſerve, ſhall be his everlaſting portion? What depends upon the meer <hi>arbitrary will</hi> and pleaſure of God, can never be knovvn by Man, unleſs God reveal it, either by his vvritten Word alone, or by his Word and Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, or by his Spirit immediately vvithout the Word. But the poor diſconſolate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93177:22"/>Man can have no hopes that God will reveal it to him by his Written Word alone, or by his Written Word and Spirit together; becauſe according to the Principle aforeſaid, the Written Word is ſuppoſed to ſay nothing at all of that matter: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ever it be Revealed to the Man, (and ſo if ever he be comforted) in this World, it muſt be by the Spirit without the Word: And then all the poor diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Mans ground of Comfort muſt be reduced to this, That God will reveal it to him <hi>by his Spirit immediately without the Written Word.</hi> But then we demand how our Authour will be able to aſſure the poor diſconſolate dying Man, that God will really do ſo, that God will reveal it to him by his Spirit immediately without the Written Word. For that immediate extraordinary Revelation being a thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends alſo upon Gods Arbitrary Free Will, he may do it or not do it as he pleaſeth; and if God may freely not do it, how can our Authour ever aſſure the Man, that he will do it? That is, that he will by his Spirit immediately and extraordinarily reveal to him without the Written Word, that he ſhall have Eternal Life and not Eternal Death for his Portion?</p>
               <p>But now if our Authour ſhould ſay that God hath given unto Man a Promiſe in his Written Word to ground his Faith upon, though he hath not given a ſtated Rule, and ſtanding poſitive Law according to which he will proceed with Man at Death and Judgment. We would readily reply thus, Either the Promiſe in the Written Word, made to the dying diſconſolate Man, is an <hi>abſolute</hi> Promiſe, that God for Chriſt's ſake will give him Eternal Life, <hi>however it be with him,</hi> whether he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or unconverted, penitent or impenitent, believer, or unbeliever? And we are ſure there is no ſuch promiſe in the Bible, and to tell him of ſuch a Promiſe, would be at once to belie God, and to delude the poor Man. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It is a <hi>conditional</hi> Promiſe, That God for Chriſt's ſake will give him Eternal Life; If through Grace he unfeignedly repent of all his ſins, and believe on Chriſt with a lively effectual Faith, a Faith working by Love; which he is bound to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of Eternal Death? If this be the Promiſe that the poor dying Man muſt ground his Faith upon, that God for Chriſt's ſake will give him Eternal Life, then this is the very thing which Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and we after him, call the <hi>Law</hi> according to which God proceeds in diſpenſing to his People the ſubſequent Bleſſings of the Covenant, ſuch as Juſtification and Glorification are: And ſo our Authour comes over into our Camp, which he muſt do at laſt, and confeſs, if not <hi>to us,</hi> at leaſt <hi>to God,</hi> that he hath groſly miſrepreſented and falſly accuſed Chriſt's faithful Miniſters, and hath endeavoured to delude the People, and to render the Miniſters odious to the People, and thereby to hinder the ſucceſs of their Miniſtry: And he muſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repent of having done ſo. But if he will yet go on <hi>in the way of his own heart,</hi> we ſhall be ſorry for him, and not ceaſe to pray the Lord (if it be his will) to have Mercy on him, and to give him repentance for the <hi>ſcandalous ſin</hi> which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in publickly ſlandring Chriſts Miniſters, and in boldly aſſerting a notorious falſehood in matter of fact, ſaying, <hi>That the new Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>a new Word,</hi> of an old, but ill meaning. And that he hath really done ſo, we have not only ſaid, but proved by the plain teſtimonies of credible Witneſſes, whereof two Sealed the Truth of the Goſpel with their Blood, above fourteen hundred years ago.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SEcondly the Author of the Letter aſſerts that the Covenant of Grace is <hi>Abſolute</hi> and not <hi>Conditional,</hi> as appears from <hi>page</hi> 18. at the end, and <hi>page</hi> 24. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he denies that Faith in Chriſt is the Condition of Juſtification, <hi>page</hi> 8. <hi>[Some ſay that faith juſtifies as it is a fulfilling of the condition of the New Covenant, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93177:23"/>thou ſhalt be ſaved.]</hi> This he finds fault with, and oppoſes to it, the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine (as he calls it) <hi>That the place of Faith in Juſtification, is only that of a Hand or Inſtrument,</hi> &amp;c. Where we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That he makes faith its being a Condition, and its being a hand or inſtrument, to be two oppoſite things, the one whereof is inconſiſtent with and deſtructive of the other; and ſo in this he not only fights againſt us, but likewiſe againſt the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter,</hi> who held Faith to be both an Inſtrument and a Condition in the matter of Juſtification, as was ſhewed before.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He makes it to be New Doctrine, and contrary to the Old Proteſtant Doctrine, to hold that <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, and that we are Juſtified by Faith, as a <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> wherein he makes the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> as well as us, to be Preachers of a New Doctrine, and Corrupters of the Goſpel; ſince they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe held Faith to be a Condition of the Covenant, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And again in <hi>page</hi> 9. <hi>[We ſay that Faith in Chriſt is neither Work nor Condition, nor Qualification in Juſtification, but is a meer inſtrument]</hi> and he affirms that their ſaying ſo, <hi>is that by which the fire is kindled. So that</hi> (ſaith he in page 10.) [<hi>It is come to that as Mr.</hi> Chriſtopher Fowler <hi>ſaid, that he that will not be</hi> Antichriſtian, <hi>muſt be called an</hi> Antinomian.] Here it is very remarkable, that he not only denies Faith to be either Work, Condition, or Qualification in the matter of Juſtification, but he alſo in effect affirms, that it is <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> to aſſert that Faith is either Work, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or Qualification, and that he will therefore rather chooſe to be called an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian</hi> for denying, than to be an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> for affirming it. This is and muſt be his meaning, or elſe he was <hi>dreaming,</hi> and knew not what he did, when he cited Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> and brought in his Judicious ſaying, with a (<hi>ſo that it is come to that as Mr.</hi> Fowler <hi>ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.) Finally in <hi>page</hi> 25, at the beginning, he ſays, that <hi>Faith in the Office of Juſtification is neither Condition nor Qualification, but in its very act is a renouncing of all ſuch pretences.</hi> From all which it is plain, that we do not wreſt his Words, nor charge him with an Opinion which he doth not hold; for he ſo firmly holds the Covenant of Grace to be <hi>Abſolute and not Conditional,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that <hi>Faith</hi> is neither the <hi>Condition</hi> of obtaining Juſtification, nor a <hi>qualification</hi> of the Perſon then Juſtified when he believes, that he glories to be accounted an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian,</hi> rather than renounce that Opinion, <hi>page</hi> 24. And he holds it to be <hi>New and Antichriſtian Doctrine to maintain that Faith is either a Condition of obtaining Justification, or a qualification of the Perſon juſtified or to be juſtified in that inſtant of time wherein he believes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we refute this Opinion, we will briefly declare to the World what our Faith is in this matter. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We do not hold that there is any <hi>Antecedent</hi> Condition of the Covenant of Grace: Our meaning is plainly this, That there is nothing required to be <hi>neceſſarily</hi> performed by us as a <hi>Condition</hi> before the Lord will make us Partakers of any Grace, even of the firſt Grace of the Covenant. For we believe that the firſt Grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> and the Lords giving of it, is not ſuſpended on our performing of ſome antecedent Condition by our meer natural Strength; This indeed would be <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> or rather <hi>Semi-Pelagianiſm</hi> condemned by the Ancient Church, and we condemn it as much as the Ancients did. We hold that there are <hi>Abſolute Promiſes,</hi> Promiſes of Regenerating Grace, of the New Heart, the Heart of Fleſh, of ſpecial Grace through which the Elect believe and repent. This is the Grace whereby we performe the Conditions required of us in the Covenant, and therefore it muſt be promiſed and given <hi>Antecedently</hi> to our performing thoſe Conditions, foraſmuch as it is the cauſe of the performance of thoſe Conditions, and the cauſe muſt always be in order of nature and cauſality before the Effect. There hath been, and is ſome difference of Opinion amongſt Orthodox Miniſters about the <hi>Perſon or Perſons to whom God hath made thoſe abſolute Promiſes;</hi> Some think they are made <hi>only to Christ</hi> for the Church according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.6. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 13.47,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93177:23"/>48. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.30. and 110.3. Others think they are made through Chriſt, <hi>only to the Catholick Church,</hi> that God for Chriſt's ſake would ſhew ſpecial Mercy unto his Select People in all Ages, and add them to the Church My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical by ſaving Illumination, Regeneration and Converſion: And ſo that God through Chriſt hath promiſed unto the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be a fruitful Mother, that ſhould ſtill bring forth Children unto God, which ſhould continue the Succeſſion unto the end of the World; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.1. <hi>Sing O barren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>For thy maker is thy husband,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 10. and then conſider the Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>That all her children ſhould be taught of the Lord.</hi> And compare that place with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26, 27, 28, 29. We humbly conceive that the Abſolute Promiſes of <hi>the firſt</hi> ſaving Grace, are not made <hi>immediately</hi> to Individual Perſons, but to the <hi>Body of the Church,</hi> to the Mother in behalf of her Children: Such are the Promiſes recorded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, 4, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. and with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. Theſe and all abſolute Promiſes of the firſt ſaving Grace ſeem not to be made immediately unto, nor to be immediately pleadable in Faith by <hi>any Individual Perſons</hi> before their firſt Converſion; but to be made unto <hi>the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> (as the Text expreſſeth it) that is, unto <hi>the true Church</hi> which is the Myſtical Living Body of Chriſt, in behalf of all the Children which ſhe as a Spiritual Mother is to bring forth unto God: Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. To Reconcile theſe two Opinions, and to reduce them into one, it may be, ſome judge it beſt to ſay, that the aforeſaid abſolute Promiſes are made <hi>both to Chriſt and his Church, as one Myſtical Body conſiſting of Head and Members,</hi> which is to be filled up from time to time by adding New Members to it; and that continual addition of new Members is made by the fulfilling of the foreſaid abſolute Promiſes; and for this may be alledged, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and this way we oppoſe not.</p>
               <p>Thus it is confeſſed that there is ſome difference of Opinion about <hi>the Perſons to whom</hi> the Abſolute Promiſes of the firſt Saving Grace, are made; and we cannot help it; for it is not in our power to make all good Men to be of one mind in leſſer matters, and we think we are bound in Conſcience to bear with one another in love, notwithſtanding ſuch little differences. But we thank God that we are all agreed that the Promiſes of the firſt Grace are <hi>Abſolute,</hi> ſo as to exclude the neceſſity of our performing any Antecedent Condition to make us capable of that firſt Grace.</p>
               <p>And we deſire it may be well remembred, That we ſay thoſe Promiſes are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, <hi>ſo as to exclude any antecedent Condition, but not ſo as to exclude the uſe of Gods appointed means for the obtaining of that promiſed Grace.</hi> We plainly diſtinguiſh between an <hi>Antecedent Condition,</hi> which is <hi>always</hi> and in <hi>all caſes</hi> neceſſary to obtain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Grace; and the <hi>uſe of God's means</hi> appointed for the obtaining of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Grace; which uſe of means is indeed <hi>ordinarily</hi> neceſſary unto Men, ſo that they have no ground to expect that ever God ſhould give them the aforeſaid Grace, without their attending upon him in the uſe of thoſe means; yet is not the uſe of them <hi>ſo abſolutely neceſſary</hi> as that Grace <hi>at no time</hi> and <hi>in no caſe</hi> can be had without them: For though God hath tyed us to the means, he hath not tyed <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to them by any Law or Conſtitution, ſo that he can never give the firſt Saving Grace to any without the uſe of them. We know God hath been <hi>found of them that ſought him not,</hi> ſo he was found of <hi>Paul</hi> and others, and ſo he may be again in theſe latter days if he pleaſe. God may give Faith and Repentance to a man <hi>abſolutely</hi> in what way he pleaſeth, he may do it <hi>in the uſe of means,</hi> or <hi>out of the uſe of means,</hi> (which is his ordinary way) becauſe he hath not made the uſe of means, the <hi>Condition</hi> upon the performance of which he hath declared that he will always give it; and never in any caſe without the performance of it. Thus indeed it is in the matter of <hi>Juſtification and Glorification.</hi> It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Truth of God's Word, and Perfection of his Nature to <hi>juſtifie</hi> or <hi>glorifie</hi> an Impenitent Unbeliever remaining ſuch, becauſe he hath declared that he will not, and it is not conſiſtent with his own Honour that he ſhould do it, but upon the performance of the Duty and Condition of Faith and Repentance.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93177:24"/>But in the matter of <hi>Regeneration and giving Faith and Repentance</hi> in the uſe of means, God hath not ſo tyed up himſelf by any Declaration of his Will that we know of, but that he hath left himſelf at free Liberty as a Gracious Lord and Merciful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to give the Grace of Regeneration, Faith and Repentance when and how he pleaſeth, ordinarily in the uſe of means, and extraordinarily without the Antecedent uſe of Means.</p>
               <p>This we learn of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> who as he affirms frequently that <hi>the firſt Grace,</hi> and particularly <hi>the new Heart, Faith, and Repentance</hi> are promiſed and given <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> and not upon the performance of any Antecedent Condition, ſo he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſſerts that the ſaid new Heart, Faith, and Repentance, are uſually given <hi>in the uſe of Means,</hi> and not otherwiſe ordinarily. You ſhall have it in his own words. Thus then he writes in his Anſwer to the foreſaid Book called <hi>The Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles <hi>reduced to Practice,</hi> page 195, 196. <hi>As God did ordain us to everlaſting Life by way of Reward of our Faith, Repentance, and good works; ſo likewiſe he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rdain us to the obtaining of Faith, Repentance, and good Works, to be wrought in us, partly by the Miniſtry of his Word, therein ſpeaking unto us, and partly by our Prayers, ſeeking unto him to bleſs his word unto us, and fulfil the good pleaſure of his Goodneſs towards us, and the work of Faith in Power. For God doth expect, that we ſhould ſeek unto him by Prayer for this, as we read, Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> I will yet for this be ſought of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to perform it unto them. <hi>Neither do we maintain that God doth ordain any Man of Ripe Years unto Eternal Liſe in any moment of Nature, before he ordains him to Faith, Repentance, and Good Works, and that to be wrought in him by the Miniſtry of the Word, with Gods Bleſſing thereupon according to the Prayers in common, both of the Paſtor and the People.</hi> By this paſſage we ſee that though Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> denies that Gods giving us Grace to Convert, Believe and Repent, doth depend upon any <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Condition</hi> to be <hi>antecedently</hi> performed by us before we can ever in any caſe receive that Grace; yet he confeſſes and maintains that ordinarily Gods giving that firſt ſpecial Saving Grace depends upon the uſe of <hi>his appointed means,</hi> and that it is Gods Will it ſhould ſo depend. And truly if it were not ſo, Miniſters ſhould give over Preaching and Praying, and People give over hearing them, and joyning in Prayer with them, in order to Converſion; for it would all ſerve to no end or purpoſe, but would be a taking of Gods Name in vain. Thus it may appear to all, that we do not believe nor teach, that there is any Condition required to be neceſſarily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by us antecedently to our partaking of the firſt Grace promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo that if we performe that Condition, we ſhall infallibly have that firſt Grace, and if we perform it not, we ſhall infallibly not have it at all.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) From hence it follows, that in conſiſtence with our foreſaid Principle we <hi>cannot</hi> hold, and we ſolemnly declare that we <hi>do not</hi> hold that there is any <hi>Natural Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace; for we know aſſuredly that there is no ſuch Promiſe in the Covenant of Grace as this, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt viribus naturae, dabit Deus primam gratiam. God will give the firſt ſupernatural Grace to every Man who doth what he can by his Natural Powers.</hi> It was the Opinion of the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> that we believe in Chriſt by our own <hi>Natural Strength</hi> without Supernatural Grace, and upon Condition that we do ſo, God promiſeth to give, and accordingly he gives us the firſt internal Supernatural Grace. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf was once of this Opinion, as he confeſſeth; <hi>lib. de praedeſtin. Sanctorum, cap.</hi> 3. where he tells us that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Error by that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received, and if thou haſt received it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it.</hi> We bleſs God for that by his Grace he hath preſerved us from that <hi>Semipelagian Errour,</hi> and we declare our abhorrence of it: And therefore it muſt needs be a great <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in the <hi>Authour of the Letter</hi> to bely us as he hath done, in charging us not only with <hi>Semipelagianiſm,</hi> but even with <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> it ſelf, which are Errours that our Souls abhor, as God who ſearcheth the Hearts of all Men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to whom we appeal; yet praying him again not to enter into Judgment with that Brother for the wrong he hath done us, but rather to give him Repentance, and then to pardon him.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93177:24"/>
               <p n="3">(3.) From hence alſo it follows that we neither do hold nor can hold that there is any <hi>meritorious condition of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> For we do firmly and unanimouſly believe that Chriſt by his Elood hath purchaſed for us, and by his Spirit freely gives unto us the Grace whereby we performe the Condition of the Covenant, the Grace whereby we ſincerely believe, repent, and obey the Goſpel. Now we are perſwaded that it is utterly impoſſible for any Man to merit of God the benefits of Juſtification and Glorification by performing the Condition of Faith, Repentance, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Obedience, becauſe we are infinitely beholding to God in Chriſt for giving us freely the Grace, whereby we performe the Condition, and without which we could never performe it. We know very well, that the Papiſts argue the quite contrary way that our Faith, Repentance, and Obedience are <hi>properly meritorious, becauſe they are the effects of God's Grace in us,</hi> but this we know alſo to be a very ridiculous way of arguing, becauſe the Argument really proves that they are not, and that they cannot be properly meritorious, becauſe they are the Effects of God's Free Grace. God by giving us the Grace whereby we Believe, Repent, and Obey the Goſpel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly merits of us our moſt humble and hearty thanks for thereby cauſing us to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Repent and Obey, and therefore our ſo believing, repenting, and obeying cannot properly merit any thing of God. But we need not inſiſt on this, it being ſo evident in it ſelf, and confeſſed by all Proteſtants that it is impoſſible for a meer Creature and that a ſinful Creature too, properly to merit and deſerve any thing from God but Death and Damnation. And this being ſo, we do aſſert (as much as our Authour doth, page 24. or can poſſibly do) ſuch an abſolute freedom of the Grace of God as excludeth <hi>all merit.</hi> But what our Authour means by excluding not only merit it ſelf, but <hi>every thing like merit,</hi> we do not well underſtand. As for the merit of a ſinful Creature, we know it to be a <hi>chimera,</hi> that it neither hath nor can have a real being, that it is impoſſible and implies a contradiction. Now what it is that is <hi>like a chimera,</hi> we leave to our profound Authour to determine. But if by every thing that is like merit, he means every <hi>falſe conceit of merit</hi> that is or may be in the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Imaginations of erroneous men; we underſtand him and agree with him; for we do (as much as he) exclude out of our own imaginations all falſe conceits of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and if we could we would exclude them out of the imaginations of all other Men, that ſo we and all other Men might aſcribe unto God through Chriſt the Glory of all the good we do, and of all the good we receive or hope to receive.</p>
               <p>If our Authour by <hi>every thing that is like merit,</hi> mean any other thing, we are to ſeek what it may be, and truly we cannot well imagine what it is he excludes under the notion of its being like merit, unleſs it be <hi>Repentance</hi> in order to pardon of ſin, and <hi>Prayer</hi> for pardon of ſin; and if that be really his meaning, and he be of that mind that he will neither <hi>repent</hi> of his ſins in order to obtain the pardon of them, nor <hi>pray</hi> for the pardon of them, for fear leſt he ſhould ſeem to <hi>merit the pardon</hi> of them; we cannot but think him to be a very weak man, and that he fears where no ground of fear is: For aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly if he do but exclude out of his own mind the proud Conceit and Opinion of meriting by his Repentance and Prayer, he needs not forbear repenting and praying for the pardon of his ſins, for fear of thereby meriting pardon, or for fear of doing that which looks like meriting pardon. His own common Senſe and Reaſon may teach him that by the very acts of repenting and praying for pardon, he doth renounce all pretence to merit as well as by the Act of believing in Chriſt for pardon, he doth renounce all pretence to the meriting of his pardon.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) We do not believe that Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience are the <hi>legal but evangelical Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace: Which that our meaning may be underſtood by all, we explain thus, we do not believe that our Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience which are the Conditions of Juſtification and Glorification accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, have <hi>the ſame Place and Office</hi> in this new Covenant and Law of Grace, which moſt perfect ſinleſs Obedience had and was to have had in the firſt old Covenant and Law of Works; for in that firſt old Covenant, perſonal, perfect ſinleſs Obedience was to have been Mans Righteouſneſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93177:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>by which <hi>alone</hi> he was to have been ſecured from Death, and to have had ſtill a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Right to Life; but in the new Covenant and Law of Grace, neither our Faith, Repentance, nor ſincere Obedience are or can be <hi>that righteouſneſs</hi> which ſecures us from Eternal Death and purchaſes for us a Right and Title to Eternal Life; when God firſt made the new Covenant with us in Chriſt, we had all loſt our Right and Title to life, and were become guilty of Death; In which ſtate we could never by any Act or Acts of ours, by any Righteouſneſs in us or done by us, ſecure our ſelves from Death, and recover our Right and Title to Life: It was the ſatisfactory meritorious <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Lord Redeemer, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that could do, and did do this for us. It was Chriſts Righteouſneſs alone that ſatisfied for our Sins, and redeemed us from Death; and that merited and purchaſed for us a Right and Title to Life. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs <hi>alone</hi> procures us the pardon of our ſins and a Right and Title to Life, ſo that it is Chriſt's ſatisfactory meritorious Righteouſneſs <hi>alone</hi> that comes in the place of that perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs which was the Condition of the firſt Covenant and Law of works. It is <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> that ſtands us in ſtead of that perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs which we ſhould have had, but have not. It is <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs alone</hi> that procureth to us the Reſtauration of all the good we had loſt, and more and better. Our Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience have <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do at all</hi> in this matter. This was <hi>Chriſt's</hi> work <hi>alone,</hi> and we give him all the Glory of it with all our Hearts and Souls. And as it was Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone that merited our pardon of ſin, and deliverance from Death; and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our acceptance with God, as righteous in his ſight, and our Right and Title to Life, ſo it is by his Promiſe and Law of Grace that the Lord gives us that which he had merited and purchaſed for us, that he gives us the pardon of our ſins and Right or Title to Life upon our repenting and believing; ſo that our repenting of our ſins and believing in Chriſt, are but <hi>the immediate neareſt means</hi> which God hath ordained to be uſed <hi>on our part</hi> that we may be fit to receive, and accordingly may receive thoſe bleſſings and benefits which Chriſt hath purchaſed, and which by the promiſe are given unto us. The uſe of this means, the performance of thoſe Duties of Faith and Repentance, is that which our Orthodox Divines call the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. For upon Condition that through Grace we do thoſe Duties we ſhall have thoſe bleſſings and benefits: The Lord will graciouſly give us them according to his promiſe, on condition that we by Grace do ſuch and ſuch Duties according to his Command. Our Faith and Repentance are not our <hi>Legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> nor inſtead of it, (that is the Place and Office of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs only) but they are the Condition which the Lord in the Goſpel hath required of us, that according to his promiſe we may be bleſſed with the pardon of ſin, be accepted at Righteous in his ſight, and have a Right and Title to Eternal Life. From the premiſſes it is manifeſt, that according to our Principles Faith and Repentance are not a <hi>Legal</hi> but an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Condition of the Covenant of Grace; and that they do not in the leaſt detract from the Grace of it. And we deſire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that though ſpeaking of Faith and Repentance <hi>joyntly,</hi> we call them ſometimes the Condition of the Covenant, or the Condition of Juſtification, yet we make a difference between them, and becauſe Repentance includes an hearty ſorrow for ſin, and purpoſe to for ſake it and to return unto the Lord, we call it the <hi>diſpoſing</hi> Condition; but finding by Holy Soripture and the Nature of the thing that Faith above other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hath a peculiar reſpect unto Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, we call it the <hi>receiving</hi> Condition, ſo doth our Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> call it in <hi>Goſpel truth ſtated, &amp;c. page</hi> 114. and we approve the diſtinction. He was not the firſt inventer of it; for it was uſed by others before either he or we were born. Now if this be true as the Lord who ſearcheth all hearts knows it to be, then let the World judge how falſe and injurious that Authour is unto us, when in <hi>page</hi> 6. he giveth the People an account of our Principles as to this matter, in theſe following words, [<hi>They will not allow this perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be imputed to us any otherwiſe than in the merit of it,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93177:25"/>as purchaſing for us a far more eaſie Law of Grace; in the obſervation whereof, they place all our juſtifying Righteouſneſs: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding hereby our own perſonal inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nothing elſe. They hold that Chriſt dyed to merit this of the Father,</hi> viz. <hi>that we might be juſtified upon eaſier terms under the Goſpel, than thoſe of the Law of Innocency; in ſtead of Juſtification by perfect Obedience, we are now to be juſtified by our own Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Righteousneſs, made up of Faith. Repentance, and ſincere Obedience.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And Page 28. <hi>[Many manage the Miniſtry, as if they had taken up a contrary deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, even to know any thing, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified. We are amazed to ſee ſo many aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt, and to behave, as if they accounted the Tydings of Salvation, by the ſlain Son of God, an old antiquated Story, and unfit to be dayly preached. And what comes in the room thereof, is not unknown, nor is it worth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning: For all things that come in Chriſt's room, and juſtle him out, either of Hearts or Pulpits, are alike abominable to a Chriſtian.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in Page 33. by an <hi>Innuendo,</hi> he gives the People to underſtand that we teach, that <hi>ſincere obedience unto the Law is the Righteouſneſs we muſt be found, and ſtand in, in our pleading for Juſtification, and that in ſo doing we neither underſtand what we ſay, nor whereof we affirm,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.7.]</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In his Appendix, Page 39. by another of his <hi>Innuendo</hi>'s, he gives the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to underſtand, that <hi>[we bring our own pitiful holineſs into Juſtification, and thereby make it ſit on the Throne of Judgment with the Precious Blood of the Lamb of God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Paſſages, that we have tranſcribed, word for word, out of his Letter, it appears, that he hath told the People a very tragical Story of ſome Miniſters; and if he mean it of us, we know our ſelves to be ſo clear of thoſe horrid Crimes, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us with; that we can declare with a good Conſcience in the ſight of God, who will judge us all, that it is as falſe with reſpect to us, as any Story that ever came out of the Mouth of the Father of Lies. For it hath been our chief deſire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to preach Chriſt to the People, to preach Chriſt both as humbled and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as crucified and glorified. To convince them of their need of Chriſt, of their being utterly undone without him; that there is no help nor hope for them from any thing in themſelves, and of themſelves, or from any meer Creature, either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth; that Chriſt is the way, the truth and the life, and that there is no coming to the Father, but by him; that there is no Salvation in any other but in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe there is no other Name under Heaven given unto Men whereby we muſt be ſaved: That there needs no other, becauſe Chriſt being not onely Man but God alſo, being God-man, he is an all-ſufficient Saviour, able and willing to ſave, able to ſave to the uttermoſt, to ſave perfectly, to ſave evermore all that come unto God by him. It hath been our care and endeavour to teach the People, that Chriſt hath not onely procured for us the new Covenant, or Law of Grace, according to which we may be Juſtified, and ſaved, if we comply with the Terms, and Conditions of it, but that he hath by his Humiliation and Obedience, his Obedience unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for our Sins, merited for us the pardon of them, with the acceptation of us as righteous in the ſight of God, and a Right, or Title to Eternal Life, if we ſincerely Believe and Repent: And moreover that he hath merited for us by his Blood, and gives unto us by his Spirit all that Grace whereby we do both ſincerely believe, and repent, and obey the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>We tell the People, that God made with us the new Covenant, or Law of Grace, in and through Chriſt the Mediator, and Surety of it, That it is founded upon, and ratified, and confirmed to us by his Blood-ſhedding and Death; and that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us all the Grace, Bleſſings and Benefits of it. We tell them, and prove to them, that Chriſt hath fulfilled all Righteouſneſs; that he moſt perfectly kept eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Law of God that he was under the obligation of; that he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death; even the death of the Croſs: That it was for us Men, and for our Salvation, that he came down from Heaven, and was humbled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death: That his Obedience, active and paſſive, was equivalent,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93177:26"/>fully equivalent to all that we ought to do, and to all that we deſerve to ſuffer for not doing what we ought, for not doing what is commanded us, and for doing what is forbidden us: That by his Obedience, and Sufferings, he hath paid the full price of our Redemption, and by paying that Price hath made full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for our Sins, and hath merited for us the full pardon of our Sins, and Eternal Salvation of our Souls, if we ſincerely believe, repent, and obey the Goſpel, by that Grace which he hath alſo purchaſed for us by his Blood, promiſed to us in his Word, and gives unto us by his Spirit. So that we are compleat in him, we have all in, and from him, who is the Head, the living, and Life-giving Head, the ever bleſſed, and glorious Head of the whole Church, in whom dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, and <hi>in whom it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell, that out of his fulneſs we might receive, and grace for grace.</hi> Moreover we call People, we command them, we exhort and beſeech them, in God's Name, to believe in Chriſt the Son of God, and Saviour of Men, to repent of their Sins, and to be ſubject and obedient unto him: The more effectually to encourage and perſwade them ſo to do, we aſſure them in God's Name, that if they do indeed, through Grace, believe, repent, and obey, they ſhall be firſt juſtified, and afterwards glorified, and that <hi>not for their Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, but only for the ſatisfactory meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them.</hi> So that we teach People to plead Chriſts Righteouſneſs onely as that which ſatisfies God's Juſtice for them, and as that which procures, and purchaſes to them the pardon of their Sins, the acceptation of their Perſons as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in God's ſight, with their Right and Title, firſt to eternal life, and at laſt the actual donation of eternal life for their everlaſting portion and inheritance. On the other hand, we faithfully declare to them, that they ought, by no means, to aſcribe unto their Faith, Repentance, or Obedience, <hi>any of theſe things that belong to Chriſt's ſatisfactory, meritorious Righteouſneſs:</hi> That the place and office of Faith, in reference to Juſtification, is to be the conſenting, receiving, truſting Condition of it, or the Inſtrumental means of receiving Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel, and with him <hi>his Righteouſneſs, for which alone we are juſtified:</hi> That the place and office of Repentance is to be the diſpoſing condition of Juſtification, or rather (if you will) of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be juſtified, it not being conſiſtent with the Truth of God's Word, nor with the Perfection of his Nature, to pardon a Sinner whilſt he continues his full obſtinate Reſolution to go on in his Enmity and Rebellion againſt the Divine Majeſty: And laſtly, that the place and office of ſincere obedience (in the notion under which we now conſider it) is to be a <hi>condition</hi> of obtaining Eternal Life and Glory; we do not ſay that it is the <hi>cauſe,</hi> (though <hi>Calvin, Twiſs, Ames, Rutherford,</hi> &amp;c. have not ſpared to ſay, and write, that it is, in ſome ſenſe, a <hi>cauſe,</hi> an inferiour diſpoſing cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but a duty and condition until the performing whereof, God hath ſuſpended the Gift of Eternal Life and Glory; and to the Performers of which duty and condition he hath freely promiſed, and according to his promiſe he graciouſly giveth Eternal Life and Glory, for the ſake of Chriſts meritorious Righteouſneſs only. And we deſire it may be alwayes remembred that <hi>from this condition of ſincere obedience,</hi> we do by no means <hi>exclude,</hi> but <hi>include the continued exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt,</hi> as that which is the ſpring of it, and which runs through all the parts of it; as alſo we hold that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the continued practice of Repentance, and Love to God and Man. Such ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience we hold to be a condition to be performed on our part,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</note> for the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory. For we learn from the Scriptures of Truth, that if any of God's People ſhould apoſtatize from Faith in Chriſt, fall from the Profeſſion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſts true Religion, and give themſelves up to the wilful commiſſion of all manner of Abominations, and dye in that ſtate without Repentance, they would loſe their Right to Eternal Life, be ſhut out of Heaven, and caſt down to Hell, there to ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire: Whereas on the contrary, all that continue to the end in the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt, and in the practice of Repentance and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93177:26"/>Evangelical Obedience, they have their Right to Life and Glory ſtill continued to them, and ſhall, through God's Grace and Mercy, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Merits be put into the full and eternal poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>If our Authour ſhould object, and ſay, that <hi>we ſuppoſe an impoſſibility,</hi> from whence there is no right arguing for, or againſt any thing. We deſire him to conſider what Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſayes in the 29 Page of his Anſwer to the Book called <hi>The Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles <hi>reduced to practice:</hi> His Words are, [<hi>When we ſay, the elect Saints cannot fall from Grace, this is ſpoken not in reſpect of any abſolute impoſſibility, but meerly upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of God's upholding them: And accordingly they are ſaid to be kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Now this impoſſibility of falling away from Grace, in Scholaſtical account, is but an Impoſſibility</hi> Secundum quid; <hi>like as we ſay, It is impoſſible that Antichriſt ſhould fall, or the</hi> Jews <hi>be called till the time, which God hath appointed, is come, for bringing forth theſe great and wonderful Works of his; but the contrary is ſimply poſſible on either part.</hi>] Thus <hi>Twiſs.</hi> Our Anſwer then is, that the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of a Saint is <hi>not ſimply and abſolutely impoſſible:</hi> Alas! it is but too poſſible with reſpect to <hi>us,</hi> conſidered in <hi>our ſelves;</hi> but it is onely impoſſible in <hi>ſome reſpects,</hi> to wit, in reſpect of <hi>God's Purpoſe and Promiſe, and Chriſt's Interceſſion,</hi> &amp;c. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its being impoſſible, <hi>in this ſenſe,</hi> yet we find it ſuppoſed, and granted alſo, to be poſſible in another ſenſe. And further we find, that the Spirit of God, in Holy Scripture, <hi>ſuppoſes greater Impoſſibilities</hi> than that ſeems to be, and rationally <hi>argues</hi> from them too: Witneſs <hi>John</hi> 8.55. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould further object, and ſay, that hereby <hi>we deſtroy the Saints Aſſurance of Eternal Life and Glory,</hi> by holding that their obtaining of it, is ſuſpended on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We Anſwer, the conſequence is falſe, becauſe thoſe who are aſſured, upon good Grounds, that they are truly Converted, and Juſtified by Faith in Chriſt's Blood,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19.</note> may from Holy Scripture be aſſured of the condition of perſeverance through Grace, in Faith, Repentance, and whatever God hath made neceſſary to their obtaining Eternal Life and Glory. Indeed if our Glorification depended upon a Condition of <hi>which we could not be ſure,</hi> then neither could we be ſure of Glorification it ſelf. But we believe, and maintain, that through Grace <hi>we may, and ought to be ſure of the Condition,</hi> to wit, of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and conſequently that we may, and ought to be ſure of our future Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is infallibly promiſed to perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs. We know the Followers of <hi>Luther,</hi> whom our Authour ſo much magnifies, as if he were for him, and his Party, deny that a Saint can be <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſure ordinarily in this World, that he ſhall be ſaved in the World to come. It is true, they maintain that a Saint may, and ought to be abſolutely ſure, that he <hi>is in a ſtate</hi> of Grace and Salvation for <hi>the preſent,</hi> but they deny, and on their Principles muſt deny, that he can have an <hi>abſolute,</hi> but onely a <hi>conditional</hi> aſſurance of his Eternal Salvation and Glorification, becauſe they ſay, he cannot be abſolutely ſure, that he ſhall not fall totally, and finally from the ſtate of Grace that he is now in. If we ſhould follow <hi>Luther,</hi> or the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> in this, what a Clamour would our Authour raiſe againſt us, how would he proclaim us to the World to be Arminians or Papiſts, yet <hi>Luther</hi> was a bleſſed Man, and moſt Orthodox Divine, becauſe in his Commentary on the <hi>Galathians,</hi> he ſeems to hold with our Authour in ſome things, though in other things, of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he be againſt him, and us too.</p>
               <p>But Holy Scripture is the Rule, and Meaſure of our Faith, in theſe, and all other Religious Matters, and according to the Preſcript thereof, we believe, profeſs, and preach to the People, that as Chriſt purchaſed all <hi>Grace</hi> for us by his Blood, ſo he gives it unto us by his Spirit in the uſe of his appointed Means, and what Saving Grace he once gives unto his People, he <hi>never wholly takes away from them again,</hi> and that if at any time they fall into Sin, againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, he raiſes them up again, by cauſing them to renew their Faith and Repentance, and never wholly leaves them, nor forſakes them, but gives them ſtill more Grace, according to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93177:27"/>their need, and by Grace prepares them for, and at laſt brings them unto Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus we deſire, and endeavour to Preach Chriſt, and now we appeal to all, who have any Conſcience of <hi>Truth and Honeſty,</hi> whether we neglect to <hi>Preach Chriſt,</hi> or whether in the preaching of Chriſt we ſet up any thing <hi>in co-ordination</hi> with him, yea whether we be not ſo far from it, that on the contrary <hi>we make all ſubordinate to him,</hi> and <hi>derive all Grace from him,</hi> not only the Grace of Juſtification, and Glorification, which are promiſed on Condition of Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, but alſo the Grace of effectual Vocation, Faith and Repentance, in a Word, <hi>all the Grace whereby we perform the whole condition of the Covenant from firſt to laſt.</hi> From the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes it may manifeſtly appear to any, that are not ſtark blind, that we do not hold Faith, Repentance, and uncere Obedience, to be a <hi>Legal,</hi> but an <hi>Evangelical Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, and conſequently, that in our Judgment, they do not hold the ſame Place and Office in the New Covenant of Grace, which perſonal, perfect, ſinleſs Obedience had, and were to have had in the firſt Covenant of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſaith our Authour, in his Appendix, Pag. 39. <hi>It is the</hi> Achillaean <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the New Divinity, that Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience is our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs, and that Righteouſneſs is our defence againſt the charge of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, Impenitence,</hi> &amp;c. And what then? Why in the following Pages he ſo ſhapes it as might beſt ſerve his Deſign, which was to make the People believe, that we ſet up our own Righteouſneſs in the place of Chriſt's, and maintain, that Men muſt be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their own Righteouſneſs, and not onely by Chriſt's. And ſo he trips up <hi>Achilles</hi> Heels by the Fallacy of many Interrogations. But it will be no very difficult Task to ſcatter this Miſt, which he hath caſt before the Peoples Eyes. In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Subſtance of this Argument was not invented by any amongſt us, dead or alive, that we know of; but ſome in this Nation having read it in ſome very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently learned forreign Divines, particularly <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu</hi> at large, and the Holy, Humble, Learned, and moſt Acute <hi>Placeus,</hi> they received it, and improved it as uſeful to clear ſome ſeeming Difficulties in Scripture, obiected to us by our Adverſaries the Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that this way of reconciling <hi>James</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> in the matter of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for the Subſtance of it was taken up alſo by the Learned <hi>Turretin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That it doth not appear, that all of us ever expreſſed our ſelves in thoſe Words for the clearing up of the ſeeming difference between <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That thoſe who do take that way, do not <hi>impoſe</hi> it upon others. We know there have been many ways taken by Reformed Divines to expound <hi>James,</hi> ſo as not to contradict <hi>Paul:</hi> And ſome conſiderable difference there may ſeem to be among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the methodizing, and expreſſing of their Notious of thoſe Matters: But yet there appears to be very little difference amongſt them, as to the <hi>things themſelves.</hi> Indeed upon the Matter all ſeems to come almoſt to the ſame thing. And particularly, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="5">5. That this way of Interpreting <hi>James</hi> his Juſtification by Works, and reconciling it with <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juſtification by Faith, ſeems to differ from the more common, modern Opinion, moſtly in the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>expreſſion,</hi> which ſome of us think moſt agreeable to the Scripture Phraſe. But we leave every Man to expreſs his Notions, as beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, provided, that if he do not uſe Scripture Words, yet he do not contradict Scripture ſenſe. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="6">6. We deſire it may be conſidered, that this way of expounding <hi>James,</hi> which we are now ſpeaking of, doth not in the leaſt contradict the Holy Scripture, but rather ſerves to explain it, if it be underſtood (as it ought to be) in the true genuine ſenſe of its Authours. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Though they ſay, that our Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience is an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93177:27"/>Evangelical Righteouſneſs, (as indeed it is) yet at the ſame time they declare that this Evangelical Righteouſneſs is no other thing but the <hi>Condition of the new Covenant</hi> on our part, whereby we are <hi>intereſted firſt</hi> and ſtill <hi>keep</hi> our intereſt in the <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by and for which alone</hi> we are juſtified from firſt to laſt. They do not ſay that this Evangelical Righteouſneſs, which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant, doth ſatisfie God's Juſtice for the leaſt ſin either againſt Law or Goſpel; or that it doth properly merit to us the leaſt good, ſo much as a Cup of Cold Water. They give unto Chriſt alone the whole Glory of having by his Righteouſneſs ſatisfied Juſtice for all our Sins, and merited to us all our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. So that our Authour was (we think) a little <hi>impertinent</hi> in putting his queſtion, <hi>page</hi> 41. <hi>What is that Righteouſneſs which juſtifies a man from the ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief?</hi> For he knows well enough that the Worthy Divines (as he deſervedly calls them) with whom he has to do in that Argument, have publiſhed it to all the World under their hands, That aſſoon as a Man who was before an Unbeliever begins through Grace ſincerely to believe in Chriſt, and to repent of his Unbelief, and of all his other ſins, immediately thereupon, Chriſt's ſatisfactory meritorious Righteouſneſs ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies him from his ſin of Unbelief, and from all his other former ſins, both Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Actual; that is, God by and for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs juſtifies him from them upon his believing and repenting. And as our Authour knows this to be true, ſo he hath honeſtly <hi>confeſſed</hi> it in the end of the ſame Paragraph, <hi>Will any man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>dare to tell a perſon who is troubled in Conſcience about his ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is his legal Righteouſneſs againſt the charge of ſins againſt the Law; but for Goſpel-charges he muſt anſwer them in his own name? I know our hotteſt oppoſers would abhor ſuch an anſwer, and would freely tell ſuch a Man, that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, and that his Juſtification from his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, muſt be only in that Righteouſneſs which he ſo ſinfully had rejected while in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, and now lays hold on by Faith.</hi> Here the Truth comes out at laſt, and in effect he gives the <hi>lye</hi> to his own falſe accuſations of the Lord's Miniſters, and acquits the accuſed: For if his hotteſt Oppoſers freely tell People that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, and that their Juſtification from the ſin of Unbelief muſt be only by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then how can thoſe things be true whereof (as was obſerved before) he had accuſed us in <hi>page</hi> 6, 28, 33, and <hi>page</hi> 39. That we <hi>bring our own pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Holineſs into Justification, and make it ſit on the Throne of Judgment, with the precious blood of the Lamb of God? Ex ore tuo, &amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Authors of the Argument we are upon, never ſaid, wrote, or ſo much as thought (that can be known) That our ſincere Faith and Repentance is a Defence or Juſtification againſt a charge of Unbelief or Impenitence given in againſt us <hi>by God,</hi> for they knew full well without being taught it by this Authour, That the God of Truth cannot be the Authour of a Lye, which he would certainly and evidently be, if he ſhould charge us with being Unbelievers and Impenitent at that very time when he knows that by his own Spirit and Grace we ſincerely believe and repent; But that which the aforeſaid Excellent Divines ſaid, is yet to be ſeen in their Writings, and it is this, That our ſincere Faith and Repentance is a Defence and Juſtification againſt any <hi>falſe charge</hi> of Unbelief and Impenitence that <hi>is</hi> or <hi>poſſibly</hi> may be given in againſt us by the <hi>Devil and the World,</hi> or by our own miſtaken <hi>Conſciences.</hi> And who dare deny the Truth of this? May not the <hi>Devil and the World</hi> falſly accuſe, do not they too often falſly accuſe us, and ſay that we are Hypocrites, and have neither true Faith nor Repentance? When this <hi>Brother</hi> accuſeth us ſo falſly as he doth in his Letter, we need not think it ſtrange that the <hi>Devil and the World</hi> do falſly accuſe us: Yea we have that <hi>within our own breaſts</hi> that may ſometimes through the temptations of Satan, or the remainders of ſinful Darkneſs and Unbelief, falſly accuſe us of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Hypocriſie, Unbelief, and Impenitency. Now if at the ſame time we are really true Converts, and through Grace ſincerely believe and repent, what Man that is endued with common Senſe and reaſon can reaſonably deny that our ſincere Faith
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93177:28"/>and Repentance is a ſufficient Defence and Juſtification of us, againſt all ſuch <hi>falſe</hi> accuſations. Sure we are that our infinitely Gracious God and Saviour allows our plea, and (we moſt heartily bleſs his Name for it) hath ſometimes by his Spirit and Grace ſenſibly helped us to make our defence by clearing up to us the ſincerity of our Faith and Repentance, and by enabling us to take unto our ſelves the Comfort, and to give him all the Glory of our being ſincere penitent Believers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that the Devil, World, or Fleſh, ſay falſly to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But as for thoſe who are impenitent Unbelievers indeed, all the World knows that the Faith and Repentance which they have not, can never juſtifie them from the Unbelief and Impenitency which they really have deeply rooted in their hearts. In ſhort, We maintain that <hi>Christ's meritorious and ſatisfactory Righteouſneſs only</hi> juſtifies us at <hi>Gods Bar</hi> from all our ſins againſt any Law of God whatſoever, as ſoon as we through Grace performe the Goſpel-Condition of ſincere Faith and Repentance: And then that ſincere Faith and Repentance is our Defence and Juſtification before our moſt Gracious God, and before all honeſt Men againſt all falſe accuſations of our not having performed the Goſpel-Condition of ſincere Faith and Repentance. But as for thoſe who continue ſtill in Unbelief and Impenitence, they have nothing to defend and juſtifie them; but if they live and dye in that ſtare, their Unbelief and Impenitence will bind upon them to Eternity the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, and moreover will bring upon them the ſorer Vengeance of the deſpiſed Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3. and 12.25.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Achilles</hi> is on his Legs again without receiving the leaſt hurt from the weak efforts of that aſſailant; who hath nothing to ſay to him without miſrepreſenting him, but that he doth not like his Language, pretending that it is unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>let. p.</hi> 41, 42.</note> dangerous, and tends to the diſhonouring of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that pretence is utterly falſe: For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That our ſincere Faith, Repentance, and Goſpel-Obedience <hi>is a righteouſneſs,</hi> is evident from the Nature of the thing, For (1.) They are Duties which we owe unto the Lord our God, and it is ſelf-evident that it is a righteous thing to give unto God the things that are Gods.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It is confeſſed by our Divines in their Diſputes againſt the Papiſts, that our Faith, Repentance, ſincere Obedience and Holyneſs is a Righteouſneſs: For they generally grant that we have a two-fold Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A Righteouſneſs inherent in us, and adherent to us, which we receive from Chriſt by his Spirit and Grace.</p>
               <p>This is expreſly confeſſed by that ſame Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> in his Book of Juſtification, which our Author, <hi>page</hi> 12. of his Letter, commends as an Orthodox Book. There that Reverend and Learned Divine affirms that we are Righteous both by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, which is our Principal Righteouſneſs; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by <hi>another Righteouſneſs wrought in us and performed by us, which is our ſecondary ſubordinate Righteouſneſs.</hi> If our Authour ſhould have the Confidence to deny this, it will be proved againſt him by Authority both Divine and Humane.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This our ſubordinate Righteouſneſs is rightly termed <hi>Evangelical,</hi> becauſe it is required by the Word of the Goſpel, wrought by the Spirit of the Goſpel, and is a complying with the terms, and a performing of the Condition of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That our ſincere Faith, Repentance, and Obedience, is a ſubordinate Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by which we are defended and juſtified againſt the falſe charge of Hypocriſie, Unbelief, and Impenitence, is ſo far from being unſcriptural, that it agrees exactly with the very Letter, Scope and Senſe of the Scripture in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>James,</hi> if that Epiſtle be Scripture, as I hope we all believe that it is; for there a Man is expreſly in formal terms ſaid to be <hi>juſtified by works, James</hi> 2.21, 24, 25. which words can ſignifie no leſs than this, That the good Works and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a good Man do juſtifie him againſt the falſe accuſation of being an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93177:28"/>or prophane Libertine. As to what our Authour ſays in <hi>page</hi> 41. That works of Righteouſneſs are only a Juſtification <hi>of Faith,</hi> and <hi>not of the Perſon</hi> of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, it is a notorious falſehood, and expreſly contradicts the Spirit of God, who faith that <hi>a man is juſtified by works,</hi> and particularly that <hi>Abraham and Rahab were juſtified by works,</hi> and not that <hi>their Faith only</hi> was juſtified by Works. We do not deny but that good, Works do juſtifie Faith, but we alſo affirm with <hi>James,</hi> that they do likewiſe juſtifie <hi>the perſon</hi> of the Believer. But how is that? Why they juſtifie his Perſon <hi>in tantum, in ſo far as they are his Defence and Juſtification againſt the falſe charge of his being a Hypocrite or Libertine,</hi> and not a true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent obedient Believer. In all this neither doth <hi>James,</hi> nor we after him diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the leaſt; for our inherent and adherent Righteouſneſs is intirely <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs, it hath alſo quite another <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Office</hi> than Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from it as the only meritorious cauſe thereof; We abhor all Opinions and Practices that have the leaſt real tendency to diſhonour Chriſt or his Righteouſneſs. We aſcribe this to Chriſt as his peculiar incommunicable Glory that (as was ſaid before) <hi>his righteouſneſs alone</hi> comes in the place of that perſonal perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs which was the Condition of the firſt Covenant of Innocency and Law of Works. And as for that perſonal, imperfect, yet ſincere Righteouſneſs, which through the Grace of Chriſt we attain unto, by Believing, Repenting, and Obeying the Goſpel, it is nothing but the Condition of the new Covenant, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming whereof we get and keep an Intereſt in Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs <hi>by and for which alone</hi> we are juſtified from all our ſins of what kind ſoever, and have a right unto, and at laſt get poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory in God's Heavenly Kingdom. We have inſiſted long upon this, that all may ſee <hi>how ſound</hi> and <hi>orthodox</hi> our Principles are in the point of Juſtification; and how we have been <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> to the People by the Authour of the Letter. Whether he did it <hi>ignorantly</hi> or <hi>maliciouſly</hi> he knows beſt himſelf: But which way ſoever he did it, it was certainly very ill done.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, and laſtly, We believe that as the Faith of God's Elect is a Condition of the Covenant of Grace, ſo that it is <hi>not an uncertain</hi> but a <hi>moſt certain Condition;</hi> our meaning is, that before the Elect believe, it is not uncertain whether ever they will believe or not; It is indeed uncertain to the <hi>Perſons themſelves;</hi> but it is not <hi>objectively</hi> uncertain, the thing is not uncertain <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> nor is it uncertain <hi>unto God</hi> whether ever his Elect ſhall believe. No, it is moſt certain in it ſelf and unto God that all the Elect ſhall believe; for God hath choſen them through Chriſt unto Faith; Chriſt hath merited ſpecial Grace for them whereby they ſhall believe, God through Chriſt hath promiſed that ſpecial Grace, and God by his Spirit for Chriſt's ſake gives them that ſpecial Grace, whereby they do all certainly and infallibly believe. The contrary Opinion to this, is by our Divines generally charged upon the <hi>Arminians.</hi> It is ſaid that the <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that it is ſo far left to Mens Wills aſſiſted by Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſufficient Grace, whether they will make that Grace effectual, and ſo whether they will believe or not, that it may come to paſs that not one Man in the whole World ſhall ever eventually believe, and conſequently that Chriſt's Blood might have been ſhed in vain, and not one Soul have been effectually redeemed and ſaved by it. This Opinion whoever they be that hold it, we utterly deteſt and abhor; and declare to the World, that as we are infallibly ſure that many of the <hi>Elect</hi> have believed already, and do at preſent believe, ſo all and every one of them in their ſeveral times ſhall by the ſpecial and effectual Grace of God believe to the ſaving of their Souls. We alſo believe that this certainty of the Faith of God's Elect, doth not at all hinder their Faith from being a condition, but rather that it makes it to be <hi>a certain Condition.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> pretend they cannot underſtand how Faith can be <hi>a Duty required of us,</hi> and <hi>a condition to be freely performed by us,</hi> and that yet at the ſame time we are ſo excited to it, and aſſiſted by the Grace of God in the doing of it, that it is done with an <hi>infallible certainty.</hi> And therefore they ſay that if we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93177:29"/>by ſuch a ſpecial effectual Grace as that we could not but believe at the time we are influenced by that Grace, then our believing would neither be <hi>a Duty</hi> nor <hi>Condition</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Arminians</hi> argue againſt Special Effectual Grace. But what ſay our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> to this Argument? Why truly <hi>they</hi> ſay it is a very <hi>good argument,</hi> that the <hi>Arminians</hi> have reaſon on their ſide, and that they do effectually prove that Faith cannot be a Condition of the Goſpel-Covenant. Now we deſire the World to take notice that the <hi>Antinomians</hi> join with the <hi>Arminians</hi> againſt us, and take up <hi>their</hi> very Argument to prove that Faith neither is nor can be a Condition of the Goſpel-Covenant. And ſince they account this their <hi>chief</hi> argument, we deſire they would be ſo juſt and honeſt as to take the <hi>whole</hi> argument and not only a part of it; and conſider that the whole argument proves that upon ſuppoſition of ſpecial effectual Grace, Faith can <hi>neither be a Duty nor a Condition,</hi> and it proves as ſtrongly that Faith cannot be a <hi>Duty</hi> of the Goſpel, as that it cannot be a <hi>Condition</hi> of the Goſpel. Either then our <hi>Antinomians</hi> muſt ſay that Faith is <hi>no Duty</hi> becauſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or if it may be ſtill a Duty, ſo may it alſo be ſtill <hi>a Condition,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the force of this Argument. For ought we know, the right <hi>Antinomians</hi> may be willing enough to grant the conſequence of the argument to be good as to <hi>both</hi> parts of it; for we are afraid they care as little for <hi>Duties</hi> as they do for <hi>Conditions;</hi> and ſome of them have plainly renounced Faiths being their Duty, and have put it over upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>his</hi> Duty and not theirs.

The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is whether Faith cannot be a Condition required of the Elect by way of Duty and free Obedience, and at the ſame time be a thing promiſed by God, and unavoidably wrought by God in us.

That Queſtion where Men diſpute about Free Will, and God's Grace, is ſo hard to diſcern or underſtand, that when Men defend Free Will, they ſeem to deny God's Grace, and when they aſſert God's Grace, they ſeem to take away, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Free Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What muſt we do then in this caſe, muſt we deny Free-will altogether? No, not altogether, for as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 47. <hi>ad Valentinum, Fides Catholica neque liberum arbitrium negat, ſive in vitam malam, ſive in bonam; neque tantum ei tribuit, ut ſine gratiâ Dei valeat aliquid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Catholick Faith neither denies Free-will, whether in order to a bad life, or a good; neither doth it aſcribe ſo much to Free-will, as that without God's Grave it can do any good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We muſt not then altogether deny Free-will, the Catholick Faith will not allow us ſo to do, nor will the inward ſenſe and experience that we have of our own Soul, and its Actings ſuffer us to do it. For as <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 83. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 98. <hi>Moveri per ſe Animam ſentit, qui ſentit in ſe eſſe Voluntatem: He feels his Soul to be moved by it ſelf, who feels that he hath a Will in himſelf.</hi> And if we muſt not altogether deny all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will againſt Faith and Experience, much leſs muſt we deny <hi>the Grace of God.</hi> For as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith in the foreſaid 46 <hi>Epiſt. ad Valent. Si non eſt Gratia Dei, quomodo Deus falvat Mundum? &amp; ſi non eſt liberum arbitrium, quomodo judicat Mundum: If there be no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93177:29"/>Grace of God, how doth God ſave the World? And if there be no. Free-will, how doth God judge the World?</hi> The occaſion of <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s writing thus is obſervable. Two Young Men, <hi>Creſconius</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> came to <hi>Auguſtin</hi> from another Congregation, and told him that there was a Controverſie amongſt them, in the managing whereof ſome had ſo preached the Grace of God, as to deny that Man hath any Free-will, and which is worſe, they ſaid that in the Day of Judgment God will not render unto every one according to their Works. This was the occaſion of <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s writing both that 46. and the following 47. <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Valentinus.</hi> And towards the end of the 46. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he gave this prudent, and wholſome Advice, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſentitis vos non intelligere,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Where you perceive that you do not underſtand, (how Grace and Free-will conſiſt,) in the mean time believe the Divine Oracles, for there both is a Free-will in Man, and alſo the Grace of God, without whoſe help, Free-will can neither be converted unto God, nor yet grow up in God. And what you piouſly believe, pray that you may alſo wiſely underſtand.</hi> This was the Advice which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> gave unto the Diſputers of his time. And it was very good Advice, for certainly where two things are both clearly revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet we find it very difficult to underſtand, and explain the way and manner how they do conſiſt, and agree with one another, we ought firmly to believe them both upon the Authority, and Veracity of God revealing, though the mode and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their conſiſtence in the ſame ſubject, we do not underſtand. Yet what we do believe, we may, and ought, humbly and reverently to pray, that if it be God's will, we may alſo more throughly underſtand. So in the preſent caſe before us, we ought firmly to believe, that God's Elect, when they are effectually called, and converted, have Free-will actually to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo that it is by the ſpecial, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Grace of God that they do actually believe; though we do not throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how theſe two hang together, how Man's Free-will, and God's Effectual Grace conſiſt and agree with reſpect to the Act of Believing. For both are clearly revealed in Scripture, as it were eaſie to demonſtrate.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Joh.</hi> 8.36.</note> But the mode and manner of their conſiſtence and agreement is not clearly revealed, and therefore not ſo neceſſary to be explicitely believed. Yet may we humbly pray, and endeavour (if the Lord will) ſo far to underſtand their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and concord, as to be able, in ſome meaſure, to anſwer the Objections of thoſe who deny either one or other of them, upon pretence that they cannot both be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, becauſe they contradict and deſtroy each other, and ſo if one be true, the other muſt be falſe.</p>
               <p>Now we humbly conceive, that the great difficulty about the concord of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Man's will, and of the efficacy of God's Grace in the act of believing, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the falſe notion of Free-will, which the Remonſtrants have learned from the Schoolmen, and from ſome of the Greek Fathers, to wit, that the formal Nature and Eſſence of the liberty of the Will of Man, conſiſts in <hi>an abſolute indifferency to act this, or that, or not to act at all, as a Man pleaſeth, and that even when all things are put together which are pre-required to his acting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that we do not ſee how it is poſſible to reconcile <hi>this notion of Free-will</hi> with the powerful efficacy of Special Grace. But we take this to be a <hi>falſe notion of Liberty,</hi> and that therefore we are no ways concerned to trouble our ſelves about the reconciling of ſuch a falſe notion of Liberty with the efficacy of God's Grace; but rather we are concerned to find out the <hi>true Notion of Liberty</hi> of Will, and to ſhew its conſiſtency with the efficacy of Grace. And we take this to be the formal Nature of the Liberty of Man's Will, That <hi>it is a power with which God hath end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed the Soul of Man, whereby he is enabled to conſider of, and weigh the ſeveral things propoſed to him, and upon the Reaſons and Motives that do, or may appear to him from the conſideration of things, willingly to chooſe, or not chooſe, or refuſe one thing, and to chooſe, or embrace another.</hi> Now <hi>this</hi> notion of Free-will is well enough conſiſtent with the efficacy of Grace. For the effectual Grace of God is ſo far from hindering a Man from uſing <hi>this</hi> ſort of Free-will, that on the contrary it mightily helps him to uſe it aright; for,</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93177:30"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Grace of God's Spirit enlightens Man's Mind, and enables him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the things propoſed by the Word unto his choice, and to ſee the great reaſon he hath to chooſe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace enclines the Will of Man to follow the conduct of his enlightened under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and willingly to chooſe the beſt Things upon the beſt Reaſons and Motives. Thus God deals with Man as a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature, capable of Moral Government by Laws and Exhortations, Promiſes and Threatnings; God offers no Violence to his Faculties, but influences him in a way ſuitable to his reaſonable Nature, and helps him to bring his judging, and chooſing Powers into Act, ſo as not at all to hinder but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther further and promote his true Liberty. According to that of our Saviour, (<hi>John</hi> 8.36.) often uſed by Holy <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in this Controverſie, <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi> There is Liberty and Freedom, both from the doing of Evil and to the doing of Good. This was viſible in our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, when he was here upon Earth, in his ſtate of Humiliation. Undoubtedly he was a true Man, and had all the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Humane Nature, in the higheſt degree of poſſible Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; conſequently he had Free-will, ſo far as it is an Eſſential Property, and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Humane Nature; but he had not, nay he could not poſſibly have any <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency</hi> or undeterminedneſs of will to Good or Evil: His Mind did not hang <hi>in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio,</hi> in an even Balance between Good and Evil, ſo as to have a Power to determine and incline himſelf to chooſe either. Therefore it is demonſtratively evident, that the formal, eſſential Nature of Man's Free-will doth not, cannot conſiſt in the foreſaid indifferency to Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, The moſt Noble Soul of our bleſſed Lord was certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Power to conſider, and judge of the ſeveral things propoſed to him, and upon the beſt Reaſons and Motives that appeared to him from the conſideration of things, willingly to chooſe, or refuſe them, and to act, or not to act, to act thus, or otherwiſe, as he ſaw cauſe. Whence we may confidently conclude, that the formal, eſſential Nature of Man's Free-will conſiſts <hi>in this Power of acting willingly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judgment of Right Reaſon;</hi> and not in the former undeterminedneſs, or indifferency of the Will to do, or not to do, to do Good or Evil, even when all things pre-requiſite to its doing and acting do meet together, and concur to cauſe it to do and act. Upon this occaſion we cannot but mention, with approbation, a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a very Reverend, and Dignified Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Chriſtian Liberty, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 139, 140, 141. <hi>As for thoſe that contend that it is more praiſe-worthy to do Good and forbear evil, having a power to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than to be under a neceſſity of ſo doing; ſuppoſing they mean by neceſſity, ſuch as is not from without, or from an inward blind inſtinct, but from an underſtanding Principle and Perfection of Nature, I muſt needs tell them there is no Propoſition in the World more falſe or abſurd — I will not therefore ſtick to ſay, that to have the Will neceſſarily determined to all Good, and from all evil, from an over-powering ſenſe of the becomingneſs, and excellency of the one, and the vileneſs, and odiouſneſs of the other, is the very perfection of Liberty. And this is ſo far from being impoſſible to be obtained by Creatures, or by our ſelves, that by the help of God's Grace, it is in a large meaſure even in this life attainable. I mean ſuch a ſenſe of Good and Evil, as ſhall certainly determine us to Good, and againſt Evil in moſt of the Inſtances of each. There are ſome Immoralities and wicked Actions, that they who have attained to but very mean and ordinary Degrees of Goodneſs, cannot perſwade themſelves ſo much as to endeavour to reconcile their Minds to. Nay, there are ſome that no Man can eaſily be ſuppoſed able to conſent to, but an extraordinarily depraved and wicked Wretch, let the Motives that are uſed to perſwade him be what they will. Such as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of God, contriving the murder of our Parents, of a moſt obliging Friend: Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of innocent Babes, and the like horrid Villanies. Surely then, a Man is capable of ſuch a vivid ſenſe of the hatefulneſs of Sin in gneral, as will (whilſt it laſts) render it impoſſible for him to will deliberately to commit any known Sin whatſoever. It is confeſſed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93177:30"/>that we cannot hope to get paſt all danger of ſudden ſurprizals, ſo long as we inhabit theſe Bodies, and remain in our preſent unhappy Circumſtances; but I ſay, ſo powerful a ſenſe of the infinite unrighteouſneſs, diſingenuity, unreaſonableneſs, folly and madneſs of oppoſing the Holy Will of our Great Creator, and Bleſſed Redeemer, may by the Divine Aſſiſtance, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, even on this ſide Heaven, as ſhall determine us effectually againſt all deliberate, and wilful Violations of the Divine Laws. For this we have the Authority of a great Apoſtle: St.</hi> John <hi>ſaith in his</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, neither can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This excellent Paſſage of Biſhop <hi>Fowler</hi>'s, may help to clear up the foreſaid difficulty, and to ſhew us how the Act of believing, may be a Duty and Condition of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet be produced by the effectual Grace of God aſſiſting our Faculties in that production; for the efficacy of Grace doth not hinder, but rather further the free exerciſe of our liberty of Will in producing the Act of Faith. So that our believing in Chriſt being an Act of Free Obedience, (notwithſtanding that the Regenerating Principle of Spiritual Life, and Seed of Faith, inclines and byaſſes us to act, and the actual Influence of the Spirit cauſeth us to reduce the Principle into Act,) we can ſee no reaſon at all why the actual believing in Chriſt, may not be both our duty, and likewiſe the condition upon the free performance of which God promiſeth to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify us, to pardon our ſins, and give us a Right and Title to Eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Our Authour confeſſeth that the <hi>Covenant of Redemption was ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditional,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lett. p.</hi> 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18.</note> and that Chriſt's offering up the Humane Nature in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, was (in part at leaſt) the <hi>ſtrict Condition</hi> of it; and yet Chriſt performed that Condition as <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and unavoidably as we perform the Condition of actual believing when we are influenced thereunto by the ſpecial, and effectual Grace of God. This we take to be a demonſtration that the meer infallible certainty and neceſſity of the Elect's believing in Chriſt, cannot hinder their Faith from being a proper Evangelical Condition of the new Covenant. And having thus at large declared in what ſenſe we hold the Covenant of Grace not to be conditional, and in what ſenſe to be conditional; We ſhall next prove againſt our Authour that it really is conditional, and that it is not without Ground that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſo to be.</p>
               <p>In order hereunto we premiſe theſe two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is with reſpect to the <hi>ſubſequent</hi> Bleſſings and Benefits of the Covenant that we hold it to be Conditional, that is, it is with reſpect to <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Glorification.</hi> For as the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> ſay in their <hi>Synopſis of purer Divinity,</hi> Diſp. 22. pag. 259. <hi>Promiſſiones Evangelii ſunt potiſſimum duae.</hi> (1.) <hi>De Juſtificatione coram Deo per fidem.</hi> (2.) <hi>De Haereditate vitae eternae,</hi> Rom. 1.17. 1 Johan. 2.25. <hi>The Promiſes of the Goſpel are principally two. The firſt is the Promiſe of Juſtification in the ſight of God by Faith: And the ſecond is, The Promiſe of inheriting Eternal Life.</hi> It is theſe Promiſes, and the Covenant of Grace in reſpect of <hi>theſe Promiſes,</hi> which we hold to be Conditional.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That by a Condition, we underſtand a <hi>Duty which God requires of us, for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſed Benefit, ſo as to ſuſpend his giving us the promiſed Benefit upon our performing the Duty required:</hi> Aſſuring us that if we perform the Duty required, we ſhall have the promiſed Benefit, but if we do not perform the Duty required, we ſhall not have the Benefit promiſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things premiſed, we come to prove that the Covenant of Grace is really <hi>Conditional,</hi> as aforeſaid, with reſpect to its ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits. And this we ſhall do, (1.) by Scripture, (2.) by Reaſon conſonant to Scripture, (3.) by Teſtimonies of Orthodox Divines, even of thoſe very Divines whom our Authour affirms to be againſt us. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We prove by Scripture that the Covenant of Grace is Conditional in the ſenſe before explained. And we begin with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 9. where though the <hi>word</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be not expreſſed, yet we have the <hi>thing</hi> meant by Condition, as really as if it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93177:31"/>were expreſſed. For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rt, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This Evangelical Pronſiſe and Propoſition is as Conditional, as is that Legal one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The man that doth thoſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> But that Legal Promiſe and Propoſition is Conditional, and confeſſed ſo to be, therefore is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional alſo. If it be ſaid, that the Condition is not the ſame, nor doth it ſerve to the <hi>ſame end and purpoſe,</hi> we grant that: For we never ſaid, nor thought, that the Conditions are the ſame, and for the ſame Ends and Purpoſes; for the one is a <hi>Legal</hi> Condition, the other is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and ſo they differ <hi>ſpeciſically</hi> and in kind: But what then? Therefore they are not both Conditions. We deny the Conſequence: For though they differ in the ſpeciſical, yet they agree in the generical nature of Conditions: And Faith is as properly a Condition <hi>in genere conditionis Evangelicae,</hi> as perſonal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſinleſs Obedience is a Condition <hi>in genere conditionis legalis,</hi> that is, Faith is as properly an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Condition, as perfect, ſinleſs Obedience is properly a <hi>Legal</hi> Condition. We remember that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old objected againſt the Orthodox, that either our Faith is not wrought in us by the Special Grace of God, or elſe it cannot be a Duty, <hi>and ſo it cannot be a Condition.</hi> But we know alſo how St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> anſwered their Objection, <hi>Lib. de praedeſtin. Sanct. cap.</hi> 11. Their Objection was this, <hi>Cum dicitur, ſi credideris, ſalvus eris,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When it is ſaid, if thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved. The one of theſe, to wit Faith, is required of us by a Command, the other, to wit Salvation, is offered us by Promiſe, then that which is required is in Man's Power, as that which is promiſed is in God's Power.</hi> To this <hi>Pelagian</hi> Objection <hi>Auguſtin</hi> anſwers thus, <hi>Sic dicitur, ſi credideris, ſalvus eris: Quemadmodum dicitur, ſi Spiritu,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>So it is ſaid, if thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, as it is ſaid, if you through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Body, you ſhall live,</hi> (Rom. 8.13.) <hi>For here alſo the one of theſe two is required, and the other is promiſed. — as then although it be the Giſt of God, to mortifie the Deeds of the Fleſh, yet it is required of us, with an offer of the Reward of Life, for our encour agement thereunto: Juſt ſo Faith is alſo the Gift of God, although it be required of us, with an offer of the Reward of Salvation for our encouragement to believe, when it is ſaid, if thou believeſt thou ſhalt be ſaved. For thoſe things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both commanded us, and alſo ſhewed to be the Giſts of God; that it may be known that both we do them, and alſo that God cauſeth us to do them.</hi> Thus <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> We find the like Objection, with the like Anſwer to it, in <hi>Bradwardin, De Cauſâ Dei,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 28. p. 567, 569. The Objection, <hi>Si Deus neceſſario requiratur ad agendum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that God concur to the proper production of every Act of the Creatures Will; ſince God's concurring or acting is not in the power of the Creature, then no act of the Creature would be in its own power.</hi> The Anſwer is, <hi>In rerum temporalium &amp; ſpiritualium adminiſtratione videmus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the adminiſtration both of temporal, and ſpiritual things, we ſee that there are more Powers and Dominions over the ſame thing, ſubordinate to one another as Inferior and Superior. — wherefore no Man ought to doubt, but that though the Will of the Creature have Power and Dominion over its own Act, yet thereby is not excluded a Superior Power and Lord, to wit, God himſelf, from a Superior Power, Dominion, and Efficiency in reſpect of the ſame Act.</hi> And a little after, he ſays out of <hi>Thomas Aquinas, The Will is ſaid to have Dominion over its own Act, not by excluding the firſt cauſe, but the firſt cauſe doth not ſo act on the Will, as to determine it neceſſarily to one thing, as he determines Nature or natural Agents; and therefore the determination of the Act, is leſt in the power of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will.</hi> We mention both theſe Objections, with Anſwers to them, out of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> to ſhew, that though we cannot believe without, but do believe by the Grace of God, yet that no ways hinders our Faith from being a duty required of us, and alſo a Condition of the Covenant to be performed by us, and we know our Authour cannot bring any appearance of an Argument againſt this, but that which was brought by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in the time of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and which he anſwered. As for the place of Scripture we are arguing from, we have <hi>Calvin</hi> on our ſide acknowledging that it contains a Conditional Promiſe of the Goſpel-Covenant,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93177:31"/>a Promiſe of Righteouſneſs and Salvation to all that ſincerely believe in Chriſt with their Hearts, and confeſs him with their Mouths. For thus he writes <hi>Inſtit. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. ſpeaking of this very place of Scripture, to wit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 8, 9. id reputans <hi>Paulus,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. Paul <hi>conſidering this, that Salvation is offered in the Goſpel, not upon that hard, difficult impoſſible condition which the Law requires of us</hi> (to wit, <hi>that they only ſhall obtain Salvation who have fully kept all the Commandments,) but upon a condition that is eaſie, ready, and ſoon attained unto,</hi> (to wit the Condition of Faith) <hi>he confirms it with this teſtimony:</hi> To wit the Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> quotes out of <hi>Deuteronomy, chap.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. and interprets it of the Doctrine of Faith in the Goſpel. Let any read and compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 13, 14. And they will ſee that <hi>Calvin</hi> did rightly conclude from thoſe places, that in the Judgment of St. <hi>Paul</hi> Salvation is promiſed us here in the Goſpel upon a much eaſier Condition than it was in and by the Law.</p>
               <p>This conditionality of the Covenant of Grace is clearly proved alſo by all thoſe places of Scripture which aſſure us,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That all who believe ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 18, 36. <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>John</hi> 20.31. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and 13.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. and 3.9, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That they who believe not whilſt they continue in Unbelief ſhall not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved. <hi>John</hi> 3.18.36. and 8.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. Theſe Scriptures plainly ſhew that Faith is a Condition of the Covenant; becauſe the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and nature of a Condition agrees to it. For (1.) Faith is a Duty which God requires of us for obtaining the promiſed benefit of Juſtification and Salvation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. (2.) God hath ſuſpended his giving us the promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Juſtification and Salvation upon our performing the required Duty of Faith, ſo as to aſſure us, that if we performe the required Duty, we ſhall have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed benefit; if we believe, we ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, but if we do not performe it, if we do not believe, we ſhall not be juſtified and ſaved. Nothing more is any way neceſſary to make Faith a Condition, but theſetwo things; and we ſee by plain Scripture that both theſe things agree to a ſincere Faith, therefore 'tis Condition of the Covenant, and ſo the Covenant is Conditional.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But now we muſt have a care that we do not deceive our ſelves and others, in thinking and ſaying that Faith <hi>ſingly and ſeparately conſidered</hi> by it ſelf is the <hi>whole intire condition</hi> of the Goſpel-Covenant, ſo as to exclude <hi>all others;</hi> for though it be the <hi>only</hi> condition in <hi>ſome reſpect,</hi> yet it is not the only Condition in <hi>all reſpects;</hi> It is the <hi>only receiving, conſenting, trusting Condition;</hi> but the Scripture gives us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand that beſides this receptive Condition, there is a <hi>diſpoſitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> beſides Faith, the Condition of receiving Chriſt and Remiſſion of ſins through his Name, (<hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.) There is <hi>Repentance</hi> which is the Condition, the performance whereof diſpoſes and prepares us for the receiving of remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.5. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto the people by Moſes, Ye are a ſtiff-necked people, I will come up into the midſt of thee in a moment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thee: Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</hi> The Call to put off their Ornaments, was a call to Humiliation and Repentance. Till they had anſwered that Call, they were not fit that God ſhould ſhew them any favour; and God ſpeaks of himſelf (after the manner of men) as if he knew not what to do with them, till they had given ſome evidence of their Repentance. He was not willing to deſtroy them all; and yet it was not fit that he ſhould pardon them, and ſhew favour to them till they had firſt repented of their ſins. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 36.3. <hi>It may be that the houſe of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their ſin.</hi> Here the Lord intimates that it was not <hi>fit</hi> they ſhould be forgiven, till they had repented; and therefore he ordered that <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93177:32"/>ſhould tell them from him all the evil which he threatned to bring upon them if they did not repent; to ſee if that would bring them to Repentance, that they might be fit for pardon, and that he might pardon them without diſhonouring himſelf by ſo doing. We read alſo that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was ſent to Preach <hi>Repentance</hi> unto the <hi>Jews, Matth.</hi> 3.1, 2. That by bringing them to Repentance, he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to receive the Lord Chriſt, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.) and to receive through him the Remiſſion of their Sins. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. And it is for this reaſon, that we call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance the <hi>diſpoſing</hi> Condition in order to pardon of ſin, becauſe it fits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us for the receiving of it through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. It may be <hi>our Authour</hi> will not like this, but we little value that, if we have <hi>Gods Word</hi> for our Warrant; As we are ſure we have for the thing we are upon: We will not differ with any about the <hi>naming</hi> of a thing, if we can come to an agreement about <hi>the thing it ſelf.</hi> The <hi>Thing</hi> then we ſtand for, and are reſolved (through the Lord's aſſiſtance) to ſtand for unto Death, is, That Repentance is a Condition of the New Covenant in order to forgiveneſs of ſins, that is, <hi>It is a Duty required of us for obtaining the forgiveneſs of our ſins, ſo as that the forgiving us our ſins, is ſuſpended till we repent, and we are aſſured that if we repent we ſhall be forgiven, but if we do not repent, we ſhall not be forgiven.</hi> This is all that we mean by ſaying that Repentance is a Condition of the Covenant: And need we <hi>prove</hi> this to Chriſtians? We thought there had been no <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or Papiſt that had denyed this; But if any Proteſtants that own the Divine Authority of Holy Scripture do deny it, it will be no difficult matter to prove it: For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That God hath required of us Repentance for obtaining the forgiveneſs of our ſius, and hath ſuſpended the forgiveneſs of our ſins till we repent. This is evident from the words of the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes— Come now and let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> And from the words of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the fore-cited place, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 36.3. <hi>That they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their Iniquity and their Sin:</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſin.</hi> Theſe Scriptures ſhew that Repentance is ſo required of us in order to obtain the forgiveneſs of our ſins, as that the forgiveneſs of our ſins is ſuſpended till we repent of them. Repentance is required of us as a means to the end we may receive forgiveneſs; and it is ſelf-evident that the means muſt be uſed, before the end can be obtained. Though the end be firſt in intention, yet the means muſt be firſt in Execution,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) God hath aſſured us of two things:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That if we ſincerely repent, we ſhall be forgiven. Witneſs <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon, Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his ſins, — all his tranſgreſſious that he hath committed they ſhall not be mentioned unto him.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall have mercy. Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That if we do not ſincerely repent, we ſhall not be forgiven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his Enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goeth ſtill in his treſpaſſes. Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> From all this it appears very evident, that Repentance is a Condition of obtaining the pardon of our ſins, and the Condition muſt be performed in order of Nature before the benefit promiſed upon Condition be obtained; as we can prove (if common ſenſe be denyed) from the Teſtimonies of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen, &amp;c.</hi> But ſome object, Juſtification includes forgiveneſs of ſin, in its eſſential Notion and Nature, and then if Repentance be before forgiveneſs of ſin, it will be before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93177:32"/>ſtification alſo? Anſwer, We admit the whole Argument, for it is a great truth that <hi>Repentance is before Juſtification</hi> at leaſt in order of Nature. They object further if Repentance be before Juſtification, then it is either before or after Faith; but it cannot be <hi>before</hi> Faith, for it is impoſſible that a man ſhould ſincerely repent, before he believe: Nor can it be <hi>after</hi> Faith, if it be before Juſtification, for a man is juſtified by Faith, and that aſſoon as he believes. We anſwer, That men needed not to be deluded by ſuch a <hi>ſilly ſophiſm,</hi> if they would diſtinguiſh, (1.) Between the Abiding Seed and Principle, and the Tranſient Act of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Between the Aſſenting Act of Faith, and its fiducially conſenting act: For though Faith in the Principle of it be but <hi>one</hi> ſingle Grace, yet in the Exerciſe of it, it hath <hi>ſeveral acts</hi> ſucceſſively following one another, and yet not ſo cloſely neither but that the <hi>Act of Repentance</hi> may come <hi>between them.</hi> Now to apply theſe diſtinctions, we ſay that from Repentance's being before Juſtification, it doth by no means follow that it is <hi>altogether and in all reſpects</hi> before Faith, For, (1.) The Seed and Principle of Faith is before the Act of Repentance. (2.) The aſſenting Act of Faith is alſo before the Act of Repentance. And thus from a principle of Faith, and by the help of an Act of Faith the Soul ſincerely repents in order to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and pardon of ſin; then <hi>after</hi> the ſaid Act of Repentance, there comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act of Faith, to wit the Act of Fiducial <hi>conſent</hi> to receive Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, whereupon the penitent believing Soul is immediately juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and pardoned.</p>
               <p>This we learn of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Inſtitutions, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. writes thus, <hi>Sic &amp; Chriſtus ſuas conciones auſpicatus eſt, &amp;c. So alſo Chriſt began his Sermons, Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>The Kingdom of God is at hand, repent ye and believe the Goſpel. Firſt he declares that the treaſures of God's mercy were opened in him.</hi> Then (2.) <hi>He requires Repentance.</hi> And (3.) and laſtly, <hi>He requires a truſt or relyance on the promiſes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have the Lords order of things judiciouſly ſet forth. (1.) He declares that the Treaſures of God's Mercy are opened in him. This Declaration of God's Infinite Mercy in Chriſt held forth to loſt Sinners of Mankind, is the object of our Faith of <hi>aſſent,</hi> and we are bound to aſſent to it, as an infallible Truth, and to be firmly perſwaded of it. (2.) He requires our Repentance, he requires that aſſenting to the Truth of the Goſpel, and being firmly perſwaded that God is upon terms of Mercy with us through him, we ſhould repent and be heartily ſorry that by our ſins we have offended ſo merciful a God, and reſolve in God's ſtrength to do ſo no more. (3.) And laſtly, That ſuppoſing we ſo repent from a principle of Faith aſſenting to the Revelation of God's great Mercy in Chriſt to loſt Sinners indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he requires that we truſt and rely on God's promiſes, and on Chriſt as held forth to us in the promiſes; that according to his promiſes he will for Chriſt's ſake be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to us in pardoning us all our ſins. When we are through Grace arrived at this Act of Faith, whereby we truſt and rely on God's promiſes, and on Chriſt as held forth to us in the promiſes, then we are inſtantly pardoned, accepted as Righteous, and get a right to Life for the alone ſatisfactory meritorious Righteouſneſs of our Lord Redeemer. But we could never attain to this Act of Faith, and thereby to pardon of ſin for Chriſt's ſake, if we did not firſt believe with the Faith of aſſent; that God through Chriſt is upon terms of Mercy and Peace with us. That is the firſt Act of Faith, and when it is of the right kind, and proceeds from the right Principle, the ſuper-natural Seed of Faith put into the heart, it is through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Holy Spirit of mighty force and efficacy. (1.) To make us repent, to make us through Grace heartily ſorry for having diſpleaſed and diſhonoured ſo good and Merciful a God by our ſins, and to make us reſolve through Grace to do ſo no more. (2.) It is of as great force and efficacy to make us truſt and rely on Gods promiſes, and on Chriſt revealed in the promiſes, that God according to his promiſes will for Chriſt's ſake juſtifie and pardon us.</p>
               <p>Thus we have anſwered that frivolous Objection, and clearly ſhewed how <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is in order before Juſtification and pardon of ſin, and yet not altogether and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93177:33"/>in all reſpects before Faith, but <hi>partly after,</hi> and <hi>partly before Faith;</hi> after the principle and aſſenting Act of Faith, but before the fiducially conſenting and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Act of Faith. And what though no Man could give a clear account of the exact <hi>order</hi> obſerved by our Souls in the acting of their ſeveral Graces, yet that ſhould hinder no Chriſtian from believing that true Repentance is in order before pardon of ſin, becauſe God who cannot he hath plainly told us in the Scripture of Truth that it is in order before pardon, as hath been proved: If then we have any Faith in God and his Word, We ſhould ſay, Let God be True, who ever proves a Lyar. Certainly it is very unreaſonable, fooliſh, and dangerous too; to deny, or doubt of that which is clear, becauſe we cannot throughly underſtand that which is obſcure, to wit, the <hi>preciſe order</hi> of the Souls acting its Graces. This may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at preſent to prove that the Goſpel-promiſe of Juſtification and pardon of ſin, is conditional, and that Faith and Repentance are the Condition of it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In the ſecond and laſt place, we ſhall briefly prove by Scripture, that the Goſpel-promiſe of Glorification and Eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> is <hi>conditional,</hi> and that <hi>ſincere obedience is the Condition of it.</hi> For the better underſtanding of our meaning in this matter, we premiſe a few things, As (1.) That this is to be underſtood <hi>upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that a man lives</hi> ſome conſiderable time after that he is effectually called and juſtified and pardoned upon his firſt believing and repenting, and that he hath <hi>ſpace</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to perform his Covenant Engagement unto the Lord, and to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance. If the Man dye <hi>preſently</hi> after his Juſtification and pardon, there is no more required on his part; the Spirit perfects his begun San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and God through Chriſt conſummates his Salvation, without requiring any more of him, than what he is inabled to do as he is a dying. But if God give him <hi>time and opportunity,</hi> and he <hi>live,</hi> It is required that proportionably to his Talents and time he ſerve the Lord in Faith and Holy Obedience, that he renew his Faith and Repentance for pardon, as often as he finds that he has fallen into ſin, and that he return to his Duty again, ſerving the Lord all his days in Faith, Hope, Love, Fear, Patience, Meekneſs, Humility, and Heavenly-mindedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Obedience that is required, as aforeſaid, muſt be <hi>ſincere,</hi> conſiſting in a real, true, hearty deſire and endeavour to be faithful unto the Lord, and through Grace to ſtand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) This ſincere Obedience doth <hi>not ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for the leaſt ſin,</hi> nor doth it <hi>purchaſe or merit the leaſt mercy,</hi> not ſo much as a Cup of cold Water, much leſs the unconceivably great bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) As this Obedience doth not purchaſe or merit Eternal Life and Glory it ſelf, ſo neither doth it <hi>purchaſe</hi> or <hi>merit our right to it; and God's actual donation of it.</hi> For it was <hi>Chriſt alone</hi> that purchaſed our right to it by his Obediential Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings unto Death for us, and in our Juſtification God by his promiſe for Chriſt's ſake gives us our right to it; and at the end of our days, when we leave this world, God will actually give Eternal Life and Glory to us <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> and by the hand and power of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. So that</p>
               <p n="5">(5ly.) Since our ſincere Obedience neither merits, nor gives us right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor yet actually gives us poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory, it remains that it muſt be <hi>the means to be uſed, and condition to be performed</hi> on our part, that <hi>God for Chriſt's ſake according to his promiſe may continue our right to, and may give us poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this we prove firſt by plain Scripture,
<note place="margin">Firſt Argument from Scripture.</note> for we find in Holy Scripture that God <hi>requires our Obedience,</hi> as aforeſaid, for obtaining the promiſed Benefit of Eternal Life and Glory, ſo as to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our obtaining of Eternal Glory in his Heavenly Kingdom, on our performing of <hi>ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him, and continuing therein</hi> to the end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is to be proved, firſt, That <hi>ſincere obedience is required of us,</hi> and for that ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me — for my yoke is eaſie, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93177:33"/>my burden is light.</hi> Mat. 12.50. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is my Brother, and Siſter, and Mother.</hi> Mat. 28.20. <hi>Teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the World.</hi> Luke 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the thing which I ſay?</hi> See alſo, <hi>John</hi> 13.34. and 14. v. 15, 21, 23, 24. and 15. v. 10, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 13. and 8. v. 12, 13. and 12. v. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. and 12. v. 1. and 13. v. 1, 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. v. 4, 5, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27. and 2. v. 12. and 3.13, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 2. v. 1, 2, 11, 12. and 3. v. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 5. v. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11.17, 18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. and 3.18. and 2 <hi>John</hi> v. 8, 9. <hi>Jude</hi> v. 20, 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to be proved that God hath <hi>ſuſpended</hi> our obtaining of Eternal Glory in his Heavenly Kingdom, <hi>on our performing of ſincere Obedience unto him, and continuing therein to the end.</hi> And to prove this, there needs no more but to demonſtrate from Scripture, that <hi>if we be obedient</hi> unto the Lord, as is ſaid, <hi>we ſhall obtain the poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory</hi> in Heaven, but <hi>if we be not ſo obedient,</hi> we ſhall <hi>not obtain</hi> it. Now both theſe are ſo infallibly certain and evident, that really it is a <hi>ſhame</hi> that we ſhould be put to prove them unto Men, that own themſelves to be Chriſtians. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none ſhall obtain the poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory in Heaven, but penitent, obedient, perſevering Believers, is it not as clear as the Sun, from theſe Paſſages of Holy VVrit? <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.21.</note> Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26, 27.</note> Compare this with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, and you will ſee that our Saviour himſelf hath declared that Man to be a Fool, that doth not <hi>do his Commandments,</hi> and yet hopes that ſo living and dying, he ſhall be ſaved by him from the Flood of God's Wrath and Vengeance. Of all ſuch diſobedient Rebels, the Lord Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Thoſe mine enemies who would not that I ſhould reign over them,
<note place="margin">Luke 19.27.</note> bring hither and ſlay them before me.</hi> And Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be <hi>revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8.</note> he himſelf will in flaming fire take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> asks the Queſtion,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>What ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers it in the place now cited, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf <hi>will take vengeance of them in flaming fire, and they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaies again in another place, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by faith, but if any man draw back,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.38.</note> my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> The Words <hi>[Any man]</hi> are not in the Original, and therefore they are Printed in a different Character. It is
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>If he draw back,</hi> if <hi>the Juſt Man</hi> that lives by Faith, if <hi>he</hi> draw back, if <hi>he</hi> Apoſtatize; the Lords <hi>Soul will have no pleaſure in him,</hi> that is, the Lord will abhor him unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: As appears by the Context. This paſſage is parallel to that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when, (or,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>chap.</hi> 18.26.</note> if) <hi>a righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſs and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them, for his iniquity that he hath done ſhall he dye.</hi> And if any man ſhould go about to perſwade people to believe that they may be ſaved, though they dye in ſuch ſins without Repentance, Bleſſed and Holy <hi>Paul</hi> by the Spirit of the Lord hath cautioned us all againſt ſuch as Deceivers, ſaying as it is written,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</note> And aſſures us that without <hi>holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand is it not as clear that all perſevering, penitent, obedient Believers ſhall certainly obtain the poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory in Heaven, through the Infinite Mercy of God, and Merits of Chriſt? For doth not our Lord himſelf ſay, <hi>Verily, verily, if a man keep my ſaying,
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.51.</note> he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93177:34"/>ſhall never ſee death:</hi> That is, the ſecond and eternal death. And as for bodily death, he ſhall at the laſt day be ſaved and delivered from that alſo. For as it is written,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29.</note> Then <hi>they that have done good ſhall come forth of their graves unto the reſurrection of life.</hi> And therefore as he ſaith again,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye, if ye do them.</hi> And his Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that God gives <hi>eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But to whom doth he give it? Why, that is viſible from the 22. Verſe immediately before. It is to them who being <hi>made free from ſin,</hi> and become <hi>ſervants to God,</hi> have their <hi>fruit unto holineſs.</hi> It is, we ſay, to them, that God through Chriſt, gives Eternal Life, as a Reward of their Holy Obedience and well-doing. God in Chriſt is moſt certainly a Rector or Ruler who according to his Law of Grace, will diſtribute at laſt glorious Rewards to all that fear his Name,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>James</hi> 1.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7.</note> ſmall and great. And as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Then</hi> ſhall the Obedient Believer, the <hi>doer</hi> of the Lord's Work, <hi>be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> Then as Holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, To them <hi>who by patient continuance in well-doing, have ſought for glory and honour, and immortality, God will render eternal life.</hi> This God will do at the Laſt Day to all that have ſo continued in well-doing to the end. For ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth hath plainly ſaid by <hi>Paul;</hi> and it is infallibly true, and will continue to be for ever true;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</note> Let who will contradict it, and ſay it is falſe.

               <p n="1">1. They have a Right to the Tree of Life, whilſt they <hi>live.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they <hi>dye,</hi> they enter upon the full <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of that which before they had a Right unto. They <hi>enter in through the gates into the city.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>how</hi> have we right unto and entrance upon full poſſeſſion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Glory by keeping Chriſt's Commandments? We Anſwer, the keeping Chriſt's Commandments doth not <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>give</hi> us either one or the other of them; but it is the <hi>way and means</hi> which we uſe, and the <hi>Condition</hi> which through Grace we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for the having our <hi>right to the Tree of Life</hi> continued to us, or <hi>not taken from us</hi> whilſt we live: And for our having full <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of Life and Happineſs given us when we die. So that 'tis God who firſt for Chriſt's ſake gave, that ſtill continues our right to us; and at laſt will for the ſame cauſe, that is, for Chriſt's ſake, give us full poſſeſſion: But he will do all this for us in the way of continued Faith, and Obedience; and on Condition that we ſincerely believe in Chriſt, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments unto the end.</p>
               <p>Thus we have proved from Scripture, That ſincere Obedience to the Law of Chriſt, is a Condition of Glorification, as our firſt believing and repenting is the Condition on our part of our Juſtification, and of the pardon of our Sins. For as the definition of a Goſpel-Condition agrees to Faith, and Repentance, with reſpect to our Juſtification and Pardon of Sin; ſo it agrees to ſincere Obedience with reſpect to our Glorification, and Eternal Salvation. And to whatſoever the definition of a Goſpel-Condition agrees, to that the Nature and Eſſence of a Goſpel-Condition muſt agree alſo. From all which we conclude that the Covenant of Grace is Conditional with reſpect to the <hi>ſubſequent</hi> bleſſings and benefits of it.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93177:34"/>The two principal promiſes, to wit of <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> are certainly conditional; which was the thing to be proved, And having firſt demonſtrated it by Scripture, <hi>Second Head of Arguments.</hi> We, Secondly, prove it by reaſon agreeable to Scripture: And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Covenant of Grace be not Conditional with reſpect to its ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits, particularly, if the Promiſe of Juſtification and Pardon of ſin be not conditional, we do not ſee how it is poſſible for a Miniſter to be faithful to God, to his own Conſcience, and to the Souls of the People in preaching the Goſpel to them. It is true, it is eaſily conceivable how a Miniſter may be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in laying before People the Commandments of the Lord, and in telling them that thoſe Commandments oblige them to believe and repent; And that if they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, they will grievouſly ſin againſt the Lord, and draw down his wrath upon their own Souls. But now wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n he proceeds to <hi>encourage</hi> them to believe and repent, by ſetting forth to them God's <hi>Promiſe of Juſtification and Pardon</hi> of Sin, we do not conceive how he can do it honeſtly and faithfully, if the Promiſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and pardon of Sin be not <hi>conditional.</hi> For when a Miniſter is preaching to a promiſcuous, mixed Multitude of People, and for their encouragement to believe and repent, is declaring to them Gods Goſpel-promiſe of Juſtification and pardon of Sin, either he muſt declare and preach this Promiſe to them <hi>conditionally</hi> or <hi>abſolutely?</hi> If <hi>conditionally</hi> aſſuring them from the Lord, that they ſhall be juſtified and pardoned, through Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to them, if they ſincerely believe and repent, then the <hi>Promiſe</hi> it ſelf is <hi>conditional,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> alſo is in that reſpect <hi>conditional:</hi> For if there be <hi>no Condition</hi> in the Goſpel-promiſe and Covenant, how can the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach it <hi>conditionally</hi> to the People? Doth he not take God's Name in vain, and abuſe the People alſo, by telling them from the Lord, that all they who perform the Condition of the Goſpel-promiſe, by believing and repenting, ſhall have the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Benefit, to wit, Juſtification and pardon of Sin; if there be no Condition in the Promiſe, neceſſary to be performed by them for obtaining the promiſed Benefit? Either then a Miniſter muſt not preach the Promiſe conditionally to the People, or there is, and muſt be a Condition in the Promiſe: and if there be a Condition in the Promiſe, then we have what we aim at, for we deſire no more to prove the Covenant of Grace to be conditional. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If our Authour will ſay, that the Miniſter muſt preach the Promiſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and pardon, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to all the People; aſſuring them from the Lord, that they are, or ſhall be juſtified and pardoned through Chriſt, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> whether <hi>they perform any Condition or not, whether they do any duty or not; whether they believe and repent or not:</hi> Then we Anſwer, That the Miniſter, who ſhall preach to a mixed Multitude, or indeed to any <hi>at ſuch a rate,</hi> is ſuch a Preacher as all People, who would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to their Souls ruine and deſtruction, ſhould have a care of, and avoid as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> and <hi>Deceiver.</hi> For aſſuredly, It is moſt falſe and deluſive for a Miniſter to tell a Multitude of ſinful People, that they ſhall all be juſtified and pardoned <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> without complying with any terms, or performing any Condition in order to the obtaining of the promiſed Benefit of Juſtification and Pardon. If the Promiſe of Juſtification and pardon be ſaid to be made unto Sinners <hi>as Sinners,</hi> and that nothing is required of Men, in order to their being juſtified and pardoned, but that they be Sinners; if our Authour, or any for him, could prove that; it is confeſſed, that he might preach, and offer Juſtification and pardon of Sin, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to all the People that hear him, and the conſequence of it would be, that all Men, even the greateſt <hi>Rogues</hi> that come at any time into our Congregations, ſhould therefore believe that they are juſtified and pardoned, <hi>becauſe they are Sinners;</hi> for that is <hi>all that is required of them,</hi> to wit, that they be <hi>Sinners;</hi> and they are infallibly ſure of that.</p>
               <p>But before he, or any, be allowed that Liberty to preach and offer Juſtification and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93177:35"/>Pardon of Sin abſolutely to all, he muſt prove, that <hi>God</hi> hath made an <hi>abſolute</hi> Promiſe of Juſtification and Pardon of Sin unto <hi>Sinners as Sinners,</hi> and hath given him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach and offer Juſtification and Pardon <hi>abſolutely to Sinners, as ſuch.</hi> Which we are ſure, neither he, nor any Man elſe, can ever do.</p>
               <p>For our parts, we declare to the World, that we cannot preach to the People, ſo as to tell them from the Lord, that the Promiſe of Juſtification, and pardon of Sin, is made to them <hi>as they are Sinners abſolutely without any Condition</hi> to be performed on their part, for qualifying them to obtain the promiſed Benefit; becauſe this would be in effect, to tell them, that God will juſtifie and pardon all the Men in the World, and that he will ſave and glorifie every Man of them, ſince they are all Sinners, and no other Condition, no nor Qualification neither, but that, is required of them in order to their being juſtified and pardoned. Whatever Promiſe God hath made to Men <hi>as Sinners,</hi> he hath certainly made to <hi>all</hi> Men, becauſe all Men are Sinners. We remember the Rule of reaſoning, which many Years agoe we learned in the Schools, that the conſequence holds good, and never fails <hi>à quatenus ad omne.</hi> If then God hath made an <hi>abſolute</hi> Promiſe to <hi>Sinners as ſuch,</hi> that he will juſtifie and pardon them, it follows neceſſarily, that all Men, without exception, being Sinners, they ſhall certainly be <hi>all</hi> juſtified and pardoned; (yea, and glorified too, for whom God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, he will glorifie.) The Reaſon of this is, becauſe God will certainly make good <hi>all his abſolute Promiſes.</hi> But it is an abominable falſehood that all Men in the World, without exception, ſhall be certainly juſtified and pardoned, therefore it muſt needs be a great falſchood alſo, that God hath made an <hi>abſolute promiſe to Sinners as ſuch,</hi> that he will juſtifie and pardon them. And ſince God hath made no ſuch abſolute Promiſe, we that are Miniſters, and ſpeak to the People in God's Name, cannot abſolutely preach ſuch a Promiſe to the People, without deceiving and deluding them, which our Conſciences will not ſuffer us to do.</p>
               <p>If this do not ſatisfie <hi>our Authour,</hi> and thoſe of his way, but they will ſtill deny the Conditionality of the Covenant, and think to put by both the Horns of our <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> becauſe there may be a third way of preaching the Promiſe of Juſtification to the People, that is, they can preach it <hi>neither abſolutely, nor conditionally,</hi> but <hi>ſome other way;</hi> we would entreat them not to conceal that other way from us, who are willing to learn of them, or of any that will be ſo kind as to inform us aright, where we are miſtaken. In order to this, we deſire our Authour (who takes upon him to be the Informer of the Miniſters,) to aſſign us a <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> between <hi>a conditional and abſolute</hi> Promiſe, and conſequently between preaching to the People, a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe abſolutely or conditionally, upon ſuppoſition that we preach it at all. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have thought that <hi>all Promiſes are either abſolute or conditional,</hi> and we know none of a <hi>neutral</hi> Nature that are neither abſolute, nor conditional; and conſequently, we have believed, that if we preach the Goſpel-promiſe of Juſtification to the People, we muſt of neceſſity preach it either abſolutely, or conditionally; and the like we ſay of any other Goſpel-promiſe, we muſt preach it either abſolutely, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, according to the nature of the promiſe it ſelf, as it may be abſolute, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. If our Authour will ſhew us a Promiſe that is of a <hi>middle</hi> nature, and is <hi>neither abſolute nor conditional,</hi> he will indeed do ſomething to purpoſe, ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rectifying our Method of preaching the Promiſes. But we judge it impoſſible for him to ſhew us a Promiſe of a <hi>middle</hi> nature, that is neither abſolute, nor conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that becauſe abſolute promiſe, and conditional promiſe are, in effect, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories,</hi> and there neither is, nor can be any <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> between contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories. And that they are contradictories, we thus prove, <hi>To ſuſpend the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, on a condition annexed to the Promiſe; And not to ſuſpend the thing promiſed, on a condition annexed to the Promiſe are plainly contradictories.</hi> This Propoſition is ſelf-evident if the terms of it be underſtood. <hi>But it is eſſential unto a conditional Promiſe to ſuſpend the thing promiſed on a condition annexed to the Promiſe;</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>It is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial unto an abſolute promiſe not to ſuſpend the thing promiſed on a condition annexed to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93177:35"/>Promiſe.</hi> This Propoſition is alſo clear from the very nature of theſe two ſorts of Promiſes. The Concluſion then follows neceſſarily that <hi>therefore a conditional Promiſe, and an abſolute Promiſe are contradictories,</hi> and there can be no <hi>middle</hi> Promiſe between them, no Promiſe, that is, neither abſolute, nor conditional. For every Promiſe poſſible muſt <hi>either ſuſpend,</hi> or <hi>not ſuſpend</hi> the thing promiſed on a condition annexed, and ſo every Promiſe poſſible muſt be <hi>either conditional</hi> or <hi>abſolute:</hi> Which was the thing to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>We have underſtood that there are ſome who leave no Stone unturned to avoid the force of the Arguments, which prove the Covenant of Grace to be conditional as aforeſaid; and they think to do it by ſaying, That there is an <hi>Order of Grace which God obſerves in promiſing, and in diſpenſing according to Promiſe his Bleſſings and Benefits unto his People,</hi> ſo as not to make one thing to be the <hi>condition</hi> of another, but ſo as to make one thing to <hi>go in order before another.</hi> To this we Anſwer, we freely grant that God doth both promiſe Bleſſings and Benefits unto his People <hi>in a certain order;</hi> and alſo that he doth <hi>orderly</hi> diſpenſe them unto his People, according to his Promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; But we utterly deny that God's <hi>Order</hi> of Grace doth hinder one thing in that order from being the <hi>condition</hi> of another; and on the contrary we affirm, that it rather <hi>makes one thing to be the condition of another:</hi> And that for this Renſon, becauſe the Order of Grace, which the Brethren ſpeak of, either (1.) It is an Order <hi>in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Juſtification and Pardon,</hi> (of which alone our Queſtion now is,) to wit, <hi>in the promiſe</hi> [if you ſinceroly believe with a Faith working by love, you ſhall be juſtified and pardoned through Chriſt.] Or (2.) It is an order <hi>out of the promiſe,</hi> but in <hi>God's will, with reſpect to the promiſe.</hi> If the first, that is, if it be an order of Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in the promiſe,</hi> then it is plainly a <hi>Conditional</hi> order of Grace; for the promiſe is conditional (as we have proved) and the gracious <hi>order</hi> of it is this, That whoever performs the Condition of it, that is, believes ſincerely with a Faith working by Love, ſhall have the bleſſing and benefit of it, ſhall be juſtified and pardoned. Thus the order of Grace in the Conditional Promiſe being plainly a <hi>Conditional</hi> order, we are but juſt where we were; for the order of Grace in the promiſe, being but conditional, it doth not help us one jot to avoid the conditionality of the Promiſe and Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But if they chooſe to ſay, that it is the <hi>ſecond,</hi> to wit, that it is an order of Grace <hi>out of the promiſe,</hi> but in <hi>God's will</hi> with reſpect to the promiſe, and ſo it is an <hi>abſolute order of God's will,</hi> that if People ſincerely believe they ſhall be juſtified and pardoned; We heartily grant that it is ſo, there is ſuch a gracious Order, or Ordination in and of God's Will, and it is plainly revealed alſo in his Written Goſpel. But what then? This really makes againſt our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and for us: And that becauſe this abſolute order of Grace in God's will concerning the Promiſe, is ſo far from overthrowing, that on the contrary, it moſt ſtrongly eſtabliſheth and confirmeth the conditionality of the Promiſe. For is not this a good, ſtrong, unavoidable conſequence, <hi>God of his free grace hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ordained (that Faith ſhall be a condition of the Covenant, and) that this ſhall be a true conditional Goſpel-promiſe</hi> [If People ſincerely believe in Chriſt, they ſhall be juſtified and pardoned.] <hi>Therefore it is a true conditional Goſpel-promiſe,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe. All this is to us very certain and evident, and therefore muſt conclude that we have proved by reaſon agreeable to Scripture, that the Covenant of Grace is conditional, as aforeſaid. And without going upon this Ground and Principle, we do not conceive how Miniſters can preach the Goſpel honeſtly and faithfully to all ſorts of Men they meet with, as by our Commiſſion we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The Covenant promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory is Conditional, therefore the Covenant of Grace is Conditional with reſpect to its ſubſequent bleſſings and benefits. The Conſequence is ſelf-evident, becauſe Eternal Life and Glory is one of the principal ſubſequent bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace: We prove the antecedent againſt Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> Book; and againſt our Authour who highly approves and commends it. If ſincere Obedience to the Lord, be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93177:36"/>of the Covenant promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory, then the Covenant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal Life and Glory is really conditional. But ſo it is that ſincere Obedience to the Lord, is the Condition of the Covenant-Promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory. Therefore that Covenant-Promiſe is Conditional. The conſequence of the firſt Propoſition is ſelf-evident. We prove the ſecond Propoſition, to wit that ſincere Obedience to the Lord, is the Condition of the Covenant-promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory; Becauſe, whatſoever is ſo required of us as a Duty in order to the obtaining of the Eternal Life and Glory promiſed, that our obtaining thereof is by the promiſe ſuſpended on our performing that Duty; and we are aſſured by the Lord that if we perform that Duty, we ſhall obtain, but if we perform not that Duty, we ſhall not obtain the Eternal Life and Glory promiſed: That is, the Condition of the Covenant promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory (it being the very definition and eſſential Nature of a Goſpel-Condition, that it be a Duty required as aforeſaid:) But ſincere Obedience to the Lord is a Duty ſo required in order to the obtaining of the Eternal Life and Glory promiſed; as moſt evidently appears by the many plain Teſtimonies of God's Word, whereby we have already proved ſincere Obedience to be a Duty ſo required. Therefore ſincere Obedience to the Lord is and muſt be the Condition of the Covenant Promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
               <p>If our Authour (or any for him) ſhould ſay, that it is true, <hi>Sincere Obedience to the Lord's Command of believing,</hi> is required as aforeſaid; but <hi>ſincere obedience to any other Command</hi> of the Lord is not neceſſarily required as aforeſaid, in order to the obtaining of the promiſed Bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory. We reply, (1.) That if ſincere Obedience to the Lord's Command of <hi>believing,</hi> be required as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (in the way aforeſaid) to the obtaining of the promiſed Bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory, then even according to that Anſwer, the Covenant-promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory, is ſtill <hi>conditional;</hi> and Faith continued and perſevered in to the end, (which is that ſincere Obedience to the Lord's Command of believing) is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: For the Definition and Eſſential Nature of a Goſpel-condition agrees to Faith under that Conſideration. (2.) We reply, That the ſincere Obedience, which conſiſts in the formal Elicit Act, or Acts of <hi>believing,</hi> is <hi>not all</hi> the ſincere Obedience which is required as aforeſaid, And we thus prove it, <hi>If it be falſe that no ſincere Obedience is required as aforeſaid, but the Act of Faith, then it is true that ſome Obedience is required as aforeſaid, beſides the Act of Faith.</hi> This propoſition is ſelf-evident, becauſe <hi>no obedience</hi> but the Act of Faith, <hi>and ſome obedience</hi> beſides the Act of Faith, are manifeſt contradictories; and two contradictories cannot poſſibly be both true, nor both falſe; but one of them muſt always be true, and the other falſe; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be otherwiſe. This being clear and undeniable, we proceed to the next propoſition and ſubſume. <hi>But it is falſe, That no ſincere obedience is required as aforeſaid, but the Act of Faith.</hi> For if no ſincere Obedience <hi>but the Act of Faith,</hi> be required as aforeſaid, that is, be required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain the promiſed bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory; then it follows by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that a Chriſtian (<hi>our Authour</hi> may inſtance in and apply it to himſelf or any other as he pleaſeth,) We ſay it neceſſarily follows that <hi>a Chriſtian (if he doth but keep Faith, and now and then put it forth into Act, in obedience to the ſingle Command of believing) is ſafe and runs no hazard of looſing Eternal Life and Glory, although he live in the habitual conſtant omiſſion of all other Duties, and in the habitual conſtant commiſſion of all other ſins,</hi> except the ſin of formal unbelief, that is, he is ſafe and runs no hazard of looſing Eternal Life and Glory, though he <hi>never love nor fear God and Chriſt, nor exerciſe any other Grace, or perform any other Duty;</hi> though he never love his Neighbours, nor deal juſtly and honeſtly by them; yea upon this ſuppoſed Principle he is ſafe, and runs no hazard of his Salvation, though he habitually and conſtantly do the quite contrary, and <hi>live in all other the moſt abominable ſins</hi> againſt God and Man, <hi>except the ſin of formal unbelief.</hi> For though theſe be ſins, great, abominable ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion againſt the Law of God; yet to him who is ſuppoſed to be a ſincere Believer, and to keep his Faith under all theſe ſins of Omiſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93177:36"/>and Commiſſion, the <hi>ſaid Duties are not commanded, nor the ſins forbidden under the penalty of looſing his Salvation;</hi> or if the Law ſtrictly conſidered as a Covenant of Works command thoſe Duties, and forbid thoſe ſins under that penalty: Yet from him being a Believer, the Goſpel takes off the penalty, as faſt as the Law lays it on; or rather (according to the Principle we are now ſpeaking of) the Goſpel binds the Laws hands, ſo that though it would, yet it cannot lay its penalty upon the man (he being a Believer) although he never ſo much deſerves it by the foreſaid abominations againſt God and Man: And conſequently he may omit all Duties (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Duty of <hi>believing,</hi>) and commit all ſins imaginable (except the ſin of <hi>formal unbelief,</hi>) and yet remain ſafe, and run no hazard of looſing the promiſed bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
               <p>Far be it from us to charge <hi>our Authour</hi> or any of his way, with ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practices; We abhor to charge any Man with holding the abſurd conſequences of his opinion, which he doth not own. We deſign no ſuch thing, nor indeed any reflection at all by this Argument; No, but our real and whole deſign is to ſhew the natural neceſſary conſequence (and danger) of holding the opinion that no ſincere Obedience, but Faith, is required of Chriſtians by the Covenant and Law of Chriſt as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory, and thereby to evince that (as was ſaid;) It is falſe that no ſincere Obedience, but the Act of believing is required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain Eternal Life and Glory. And this, we think, we have effectually done; for if no ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but the Act of believing, be required of Chriſtians by the Law of Chriſt, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain Eternal Life and Glory; then it is ſelf-evident that they are ſafe, and may obtain Eternal Life and Glory, if they have the Act of Faith, and the Obedience which by it they yield to the Command of believing: Though they want all other ſincere Obedience, and that is, though they live in the Love and Practice of all manner of ſins, except the ſin of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. If <hi>our Authour</hi> object, (1.) That though ſincere Obedience diſtinct from Faith be not required of Chriſtians as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain Eternal Life and Glory, yet it is required as neceſſary to <hi>ſignifie and evidence</hi> to a Chriſtian the <hi>ſincerity of his Faith,</hi> which he cannot be ſure of, unleſs it be evidenced to him by ſincere Obedience diſtinct from it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer, (1.) We ſuppoſe he knows well enough that there are ſome who hold the quite contrary, to wit, that it is <hi>Faith only</hi> which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to evidence the ſincerity of a mans Obedience, and not ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to evidence the ſincerity of his Faith. (2.) Be it ſo, that ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is indiſpenſably neceſſary to aſſure a Chriſtian of <hi>the ſincerity of his Faith,</hi> yet if it be not likewiſe indiſpenſably neceſſary to his <hi>obtaining Eternal Life and Glory,</hi> he may be <hi>really ſafe</hi> and in no danger of looſing Eternal Life and Glory, if he have a ſincere Faith, which is the only thing indiſpenſably neceſſary, though he want all ſincere Obedience (diſtinct from Faith,) which is pretended not to be indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory. It is true the man cannot <hi>know</hi> that he is ſafe, he cannot be <hi>ſure</hi> and full of Spiritual Comfort, without the evidence of his Faith, that is, without ſincere Obedience: But for all that, if he really have Faith, he is <hi>ſafe</hi> with reſpect to another World, though he want ſincere Obedience as the <hi>evidence of his ſafety</hi> by Faith, and that is, though he live in the Love and Practice of all manner of ſins, both of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, except the ſin of formal Unbelief; which we think is a very great abſurdity following upon the foreſaid Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If our Authour object, (2.) That here we ſuppoſe an <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> to wit, That a ſincere Faith may be without any other ſincere Obedience, whereas though ſincere Obedience be not required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain Eternal Life and Glory, yet there always is and will be ſincere Obedience where there is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith, and can never be ſeparated from it.</p>
               <p>We Anſwer, (1.) That we do not argue from an impoſſibility as ſuch, but wholly abſtracting from its being poſſible or impoſſible for a ſincere Faith to be without
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93177:37"/>ſincere Obedience to the Lord in other things required of Chriſtians, we prove it to be falſe that no ſincere Obedience, but the Act of Faith is under the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant required of Chriſtians, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain the promiſed bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory; becauſe if that were not falſe, then this would be neceſſarily true, that though a Chriſtian <hi>ſhould</hi> live in the Love and Practice of all other abominations, yet if <hi>(per poſſibile vel impoſſibile)</hi> he retain but the Act of Faith, he is ſafe and ſecure with reſpect to his Eternal Salvation, and runs no hazard of looſing Eternal Life and Glory. It is only this <hi>conſequence</hi> which we are concerned to make good, and that we have done. But though the <hi>conſequence</hi> and inference be good, yet the <hi>conſequent</hi> or thing inferred, we juſtly account to be a very great abſurdity, and from that abſurdity we prove the falſehood of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and principle from whence it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that is, the falſehood of the Principle, which ſaith that no ſincere Obedience but the act of Faith is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We Anſwer, that though we ſuppoſe and grant it impoſſible for a ſincere Faith to be without ſincere Obedience, yet we may very well ſay, that it is a great falſehood that no other Obedience but that of the formal elicit Act of Faith, is required of Chriſtians as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, and may prove it by this Argument. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> per impoſſibile <hi>that a Chriſtian have a ſincere Faith ſeparated from ſincere Obedience, if nothing but a ſincere Act of Faith be required of him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, he is ſafe and runs no hazard of looſing Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though he lead a wicked life as aforeſaid.</hi> But <hi>this is falſe and abſurd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that principle from whence this follows is falſe and abſurd alſo,</hi> that is, it is falſe and abſurd that nothing but an Act of Faith is required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation. And not only Logick allows us to argue thus ſometimes from <hi>a ſuppoſed impoſſibility,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 8.55.</note> but even our bleſſed Saviour who is truth it ſelf hath done it before us. <hi>If I ſhould ſay,</hi> (quoth our Saviour) <hi>I know not the Father, I ſhould be a lyer like unto you; but I know him,</hi> &amp;c. In like manner S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues <hi>ab impoſſibili,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Though we or an angel from heaven,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> preach another Goſpel to you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) We Anſwer, That when it is ſaid, that ſincere Faith cannot be without ſincere Obedience, the meaning is, that ſincere Faith is of an Obediential Nature, and is of it ſelf <hi>apt</hi> to put us upon the ſeveral Acts of ſincere Obedience, and will certainly do it, if it be rightly uſed, and put forth into ſtrong vigorous Acts, if the Spirit of the Lord concur with it, if it be not hindred by the fleſh, and by the prevalency of tentations: But the meaning is not that ſincere Faith, <hi>always actually and infallibly produceth the imperat acts of ſincere Obedience,</hi> as neceſſarily as the Sun produces light, and as the Fire produceth Heat. For the Principle of ſincere Faith doth not ſo <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily</hi> produce its <hi>own formal elicit Acts,</hi> much leſs doth it ſo <hi>neceſſarily</hi> produce the <hi>Acts of other gracious Principles</hi> and Habits, whoſe Acts are <hi>not the formal elicit,</hi> but the <hi>imperat Acts of Faith.</hi> And it is but too well known, by ſad experience, that the Principle of ſincere Faith, (or even the languid, weak Act of that Principle,) doth not neceſſarily, and infallibly alwayes produce all thoſe Acts of ſincere Obedience to the Lord, which are neceſſary towards the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory. For had not <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> a Principle of ſincere Faith, (and who can ſay and prove that they had not then ſome weak, languid Acts of Faith?) And yet that Faith in them, for ſome conſiderable time, was ſeparated from that ſincere Repentance and Obedience, which is required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory. This is too evident to be denyed. And ſurely what hath been, is poſſible to be, though we heartily wiſh that it may never actually be any more; and that none of God's People may ever fall ſo foully, nor lye ſo long in Sin, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did. But we think <hi>our Authour</hi> (or any for him) will find it a hard Task to prove, that <hi>ſincere Faith</hi> (both as to the Habit, and ſome weak Act)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93177:37"/>cannot be, for ſome time, actually <hi>ſeparated from ſuch imperat Acts of Repentance and ſincere Obedience as are indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining poſſeſſion of Eternal Life</hi> and Glory in Heaven; and further he may find it a Task no leſs hard to determine preciſely <hi>how long time</hi> they may be actually ſeparated, <hi>but not one Minute longer.</hi> If he think, that he can do either, or both of theſe, we do intrent him to do it, for in truth it will be a kindneſs to us, who do really find the difficulty ſo great, that we are not able to maſter it without help.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) We Anſwer, That though it were well proved that ſincere Faith can in no caſe be ſeparated for one Minute from the imperate Acts of that ſincere Repentance and Obedience which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory in Heaven; yet it doth by no means follow that <hi>Faith onely, and not ſincere Obedience</hi> diſtinct from Faith, is required of us, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Glory in Heaven; for Faith and Obedience may <hi>both</hi> be required, and we have already proved by plain Scripture that <hi>they are both</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory, and without our having <hi>both</hi> as the Lord hath required, we cannot be out of danger of coming ſhort of Eternal Life and Glory. The clear evidence of this Truth, hath made our ableſt, and moſt Judicious Divines acknowledge that <hi>upon ſuppoſition, that the Saints fallen into groſs ſins againſt Knowledge and Conſcience,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, ſhould dye in them before they had, through Grace, returned unto their Obedience to the Lord, renewed both their Faith, and their Repentance, and got both the Guilt and Filth of thoſe Sins waſhed and purged away by the moſt pretious Blood, and holy Spirit of Chriſt, they would be damned, and loſt for ever.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his <hi>Examen Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſmi, p.</hi> 620. acknowledges to be a Truth in theſe Words, <hi>[Niſi renati (in atrecia peccata lapſi) reſipiſcerent, in aeternum ipſis pereundum eſſet, juxta comminationes Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licas.] <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the Regenerate (after they have fallen into atrocious ſins) did repent, they muſt periſh everlaſtingly, according to the threatnings of the Goſpel.</hi> Of this Perſwaſion were our excellent Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> ſo was Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Abbot, Downham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burgeſs, Pareus, Turretin,</hi> &amp;c. as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words of moſt of them. This ſame Truth hath alſo been acknowledged and maintained by the <hi>French</hi> Divines, who Anſwered that peſtilent Book of the <hi>Janſenians,</hi> called the <hi>Renverſement</hi> (and corruption) <hi>of the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt by the Errors of the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>in the point of Juſtification. Jurieu</hi> and others in anſwer to that moſt virulent Book, go upon our Principle aforeſaid, and thereby vindicate the Reformed Churches from the blaſphemous Reproaches which the <hi>Janſenians</hi> caſt upon us all, upon pretence that we all hold the abominable Opinion aforeſaid, that we are ſafe as to our Eternal ſtate, if we have but a true Faith, though we live in the love and practice of all manner of Villanies, except Unbelief.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) One great Reaſon, (we do not ſay the onely, but one great Reaſon) on our part, why a ſincere Faith is of its own Nature obediential, that is, it inclines to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and is of it ſelf naturally apt to produce in us ſincere Obedience, and will not fail to do it, if it be rightly uſed, and be not hindred; It is this; a ſincere Faith firmly aſſents to the Truth of the foreſaid Commands, Promiſes, and Threatnings of the Goſpel, whereby we have proved that ſincere Obedience is by the Lord made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary unto, and the condition of obtaining Eternal Salvation; and from the infallible Truth of God's Word it aſſures us that there is no obtaining of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, unleſs we be ſincerely obedient unto the Lord; that if through Grace we be ſincerely obedient we ſhall be ſaved; but if not, we ſhall be damned. Now this Faith acting upon the ſeveral parts of God's Word, according to their reſpective Natures, is of great force and efficacy to determine us unto the practice of ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; (1.) the Faith of God's Word commanding ſincere Obedience, as indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to Salvation, makes our Conſciences how down to God's Authority in the Command, and makes us endeavour to yeild Obedience to it. (2.) The Faith of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93177:38"/>God's Word of threatning againſt the diſobedient Rebel, works upon our Fears,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1.</note> and Fear reſtrains us from diſobedience, leſt thereby we ſhould bring upon our ſelves the everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned. (3.) The Faith of God's Word of Promiſe to obedient Believers, works upon our hope, and hope quickens us unto Obedience, as the neceſſary means to obtain the Eternal Reward promiſed; It makes us follow after Holineſs in expectation of Happineſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, 3. It is eſſential to ſaving Faith to act thus differently on the ſeveral parts of the Word according to their reſpective Natures, making us <hi>tremble at the Threatnings, embrace the Promiſes, and by that means obey the Commands of God.</hi> As our Confeſſion of Faith intimates in Chap. 14. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. Now our Faith its being thus naturally fitted to make us ſincerely obedient unto the Lord in all his Commands and Inſtitutions, ariſeth partly from hence, that the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable <hi>neceſſity of ſincere Obedience, in order to the obtaining of Eternal Salvation,</hi> is <hi>one of the objects of a ſound Faith,</hi> which it firmly aſſents to, and is ſtrongly perſwaded of: For this firm aſſent, and ſtrong perſwaſion, that ſincere Obedience is ſo neceſſary to Salvation, will not let us reſt, but will be ſtill putting us on to yeild ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the Law of Chriſt, as that which muſt be done or we ſhall be undone for ever. But if a Man be once firmly perſwaded in his own Mind, that <hi>no ſincere Obedience, but onely the Act of Faith</hi> in way of Obedience, is indiſpenſably <hi>neceſſary to Salvation;</hi> his Faith will not have ſo much Power over him to make him ſincerely obedient unto the Lord, in order to Salvation. Indeed it is much to be doubted whether that Man hath a ſincere Faith at all, who is under the Power of this erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinion, that <hi>no ſincere Obedience diſtinct from the Act of Faith, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation;</hi> for a ſincere, ſound Faith amongſt other of its Objects, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves this for one, that as, firſt, Faith, ſo <hi>next ſincere Obedience is indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have proved our Second Propoſition, to wit, It is falſe, that no ſincere Obedience (but the Act of Faith) is required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſed Bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
               <p>Now both the Premiſſes being certainly and evidently true, the Concluſion follows unavoidably, which is this, That it is true, that ſome Obedience (beſides the Act of Faith) is required as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of the promiſed Bleſſing of Eternal Life and Glory. For who is ſo ſtark blind as not to ſee that <hi>if it be falſe that no Obedience, but Faith is</hi> indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, (as we have proved it to be falſe;) then its contradictory is true, that <hi>ſome Obedience, beſides Faith, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> We proceed then, and thus argue, <hi>If ſome Obedience, beſides Faith, be indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, then that ſome Obedience, beſides Faith, muſt be</hi> either a moſt <hi>perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs</hi> Obedience, or an <hi>imperfect, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſincere</hi> Obedience. There can be no other perſonal Obedience, but one of theſe two, thought indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>But it is not, it cannot be a moſt perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs Obedience;</hi> for if ſuch an Obedience were required, as indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to Salvation; then no Man could be ſaved, becauſe no meer Man ever performed ſuch Obedience to the Law of God in this life, no Man ever lived ſo holily as never to ſin in Thought, Word or Deed, after his Converſion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And ſo if ſuch ſinleſs, perſonal Obedience were required of all as indiſpenſably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>ſary to Salvation, no Fleſh could be ſaved, but all would be damned; notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered to purchaſe Salvation for his People. Chriſt's blood would have been ſo far ſhed in vain, that not one Soul would be ſaved by it, which were Blaſphemy to affirm; and therefore it cannot be that now under the Goſpel-Covenant, a moſt perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs Obedience is required of us, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation. Since therefore ſome perſonal Obedience, beſides Faith, is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to Salvation, and it is not a moſt perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs Obedience, that is ſo neceſſary, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that <hi>it is an imperfect, perſonal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, which</hi> beſides Faith, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation. The other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93177:38"/>moſt perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs Obedience is not attainable in this Life by the ordinary aſſiſtance of God's Grace, but this perſonal, imperfect, yet ſincere Obedience, is attainable in this Life, by the ordinary helps of God's Spirit and Grace. <hi>For Christ's yoke is eaſie, and his burden is light,</hi> Mat. 11.30. And <hi>God's Commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5.3. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. <hi>Through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>We purify our ſouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1.22. In ſhort though <hi>without Chriſt we can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. <hi>Yet through Chriſt ſtrengthening us we can do all things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. that is, <hi>we can do all</hi> things which Chriſt requires of us as indiſpenſably neceſſary to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the promiſed Bleſſing of Eternal Life and Salvation. If any ſhould object againſt this, and ſay, that <hi>a Man may be ſaved although he do not perform that Obedience which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> becauſe though he fall into very great Sins, yet <hi>he may repent of them, and ſo be ſaved through Chriſt upon his repentance.</hi> We Anſwer, (1.) That it is contradictious Non-ſence to ſay a Man may be ſaved without that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, which God hath made indiſpenſably neceſſary to his Salvation. (2.) We anſwer with <hi>Rutherford</hi> and others, as aforeſaid, that when a Regenerate Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Man fulls into groſs Sins againſt Knowledge and Conſcience; he cannot be ſaved whilſt he continues in thoſe Sins without Repentance, for then he doth <hi>not walk after the Spirit,</hi> but rather <hi>after the Fleſh;</hi> then he is going <hi>aſtray from the way</hi> that leads to Life and Salvation, and is walking in the <hi>broad way</hi> that leads to deſtruction: And therefore if he do not turn back, and return again into the <hi>narrow way</hi> that leads to Life and Salvation, he will certainly be undone, he will periſh everlaſtingly; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die.</hi> But when a juſtified Man, that had fallen, as is ſaid, riſes again by Repentance, he returns to his Obedience: And we deſire it may be obſerved and remembred, that when we ſay ſincere Obedience is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to Salvation, we do not mean that it is required as <hi>abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably</hi> neceſſary to our Salvation, that our ſincere Obedience <hi>be never at all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> by any Acts of diſobedience, but that if it happen that our Obedience be at any time notably interrupted by Acts of wilful, preſumptuous Sin; it is <hi>indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably</hi> neceſſary to our Salvation, that we <hi>renew our Faith and Repentance, and return to our Obedience again,</hi> and that we dye in Faith and Obedience to the revealed Will of God. As for them who are called at the laſt Hour, who are firſt converted and juſtified <hi>a little before their Death; Actual Faith and Repentance</hi> is required of them in their own Perſons, and <hi>as much more ſincere Obedience as they have time and ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</hi> As we ſee in the penitent Thief, he performed a great deal of Obedience in a little time, he not onely believed in Chriſt with his Heart, but confeſſed him with his Mouth, pleaded for him, and vindicated him from the blaſphemous Aſperſions that were caſt upon him. He likewiſe took ſhame to himſelf, and gave Glory to God by confeſſing his own Sins; and withal he expreſſed his Love to his Fellow-Thief by rebuking and admoniſhing him. Laſtly, He truſted in, and prayed unto Chriſt, as a Lord and King, who had a Kingdome in another World, and who could help and ſave him after this Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.40, 41, 42. This that penitent Malefactor did at his Death, and truly this was a great deal for him to do at ſuch a time, and when Chriſt, his Lord and Saviour, was before his Face in ſo low and miſerable a Condition to the Eye of Senſe and Reaſon. The Obedience which that poor penitent Believer, yeilded to the Lord in ſuch Circumſtances, may well be eſteemed <hi>equivalent</hi> to all that ſincere Obedience which in the ſpace of <hi>many Years, others in better Circumſtances</hi> perform unto the Lord. Thus we have at large proſecuted and cleared this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the indiſpenſable neceſſity of ſincere Obedience to the obtaining of Eternal Life and Salvation, and conſequently for the Conditionality of the Covenant-promiſe of Eternal Life and Salvation. And the Argument ſeems to us ſo clear and cogent, that we do not ſee any thing of weight that can be objected againſt it. If any ſhould ſay, that ſincere, Evangelical Obedience, is <hi>not only</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to be performed on our parts; but <hi>upon other accounts alſo:</hi> We heartily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93177:39"/>that it is ſo; It is neceſſary to expreſs our Love and Thankfulneſs to God and Chriſt for their wonderful Goodneſs and Grace, Mercy and Love to us: As alſo it is neceſſary in order to the pleaſing, and Glorifying our God, Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; and that thereby we may profit and edifie our Neighbours: But this doth by no means hinder its being likewiſe indiſpenſably neceſſary to our own Salvation, nay all this is a part of that Obedience which is ſo neceſſary to our Salvation. If yet any ſhould further object, and ſay, that beſides Faith, ſincere Obedience may be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably <hi>neceſſary to Salvation, and yet not be a Condition of obtaining Salvation.</hi> We anſwer, that we do not love to contend with any about the uſe of the word <hi>condition,</hi> if they will grant us the thing ſignified by the Word. Now by the Word condition in this matter of Obedience, we mean no more, but that <hi>ſincere</hi> Obedience is <hi>ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, that God by his Promiſe hath ſuſpended our obtaining of Salvation,</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Salvation in Heavenly Glory,) <hi>till we have performed ſincere Obedience unto him, aſſuring us that if through Grace we perform ſincere Obedience unto him, we ſhall certainly be ſaved, but if not, we ſhall not be ſaved.</hi> This is all we mean by ſincere Obedience its being the Condition of the Covenant-promiſe of Salvation. If our Brethren agree to this, they yeild us <hi>the thing</hi> that we contend for; and there remains no more difference as to this matter, but about the uſe of <hi>the word</hi> condition; and if they do not think fit to uſe that Word, we leave them to their Liberty, not to uſe it, as we deſire they would leave us to our Liberty to uſe it, as we have occaſion. For though the Word be not in Scripture, yet the thing ſignified by the Word, is manifeſtly there, as we have proved. It is alſo a Word of Antient uſage in the Chriſtian Church, even in the beſt Reformed Churches, before ever we were born; why then ſhould we forbear the uſe of the Word [condition,] or why ſhould any be offended at our uſing of it? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we cannot forbear the uſing of it, for the Reaſon given us by ſome well-meaning Men, becauſe it is not a Scriptural-word: For if that Reaſon prove any thing it will prove too much, to wit, that we ſhould not uſe the Words, <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Merit of Chriſt, Sacrament, Infant-baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. and which is more, that we ſhould wholly <hi>give over Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> and hereafter <hi>only Read</hi> the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without Expounding it, for we are ſure, that no Man doth, or can, Preach one Sermon without uſing ſome Word, or Words, that are not expreſly in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>And as our ſincere Obedience may be, and really is a Condition of obtaining Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, though it be not expreſly called by that Name in Scripture; ſo may it be, and really it is a Condition, <hi>though it be performed by the help of God's Grace.</hi> We know this is the main Reaſon why our Brethren think that neither our Faith, nor Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, can be a Condition of the Covenant, <hi>becauſe they are wrought in us by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and effectual Grace of God;</hi> but we know alſo that this is a very weak Reaſon. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) We do not ſay that that is the Condition of the Covenant which is the Work and Effect of <hi>Gods Grace alone.</hi> Such is effectual Calling on God's part, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Seminal abiding principle of ſupernatural Spiritual Life. It is God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who calls us effectually, and who infuſes the ſaid Principle of Grace and Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Souls, and we are <hi>merely paſſive</hi> in the reception of it. We never ſaid nor thought that it is required of us by way of Duty or Condition that we ſhould effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually <hi>call our ſelves,</hi> and infuſe a ſupernatural Principle of Grace and Life into our ſelves. This indeed would be very abſurd; Therefore we hold that our being effectually called, and our having an abiding principle of Grace and Life given in unto us, is, <hi>quid prae-requiſitum,</hi> ſomething pre-required to our right performing the condition, but not the condition it ſelf; That which is required of us by way of Duty and Condition on which God promiſeth us the ſubſequent bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, It is that we do not reſiſt his Spirit, and that <hi>by the grace of his Spirit we do actually believe and obey, and perſevere to the end.</hi> Now the Grace of God whereby we believe and obey, is ſo far from hindring our actual Faith, and Obedience from being the Condition, that on the contrary it conduceth very much to make them the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93177:39"/>Condition, the Gracious Evangelical Condition of the Covenant, and without it they could not be ſuch a Condition. As to what they ſay that ſpecial Grace <hi>neceſſarily</hi> cauſeth our Faith and Obedience, we anſwered before that ſpecial Grace doth not cauſe our actual Faith and Obedience with any ſuch kind of neceſſity as is inconſiſtent with, or deſtructive of the true liberty of our Souls in believing and obeying. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the great aſſerter of the neceſſity and efficacy of Supernatural Grace againſt the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> ſays in his 46 <hi>Epist.</hi> to <hi>Valentinus, Obedientiam noſtram (Deus) requirit, quae nulla poteſt eſſe ſine libero arbitrio. God requires our Obedience, which without the liberty of our minds can be no obedience.</hi> And our own <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion of Faith in <hi>chap,</hi> 19. <hi>atr.</hi> 7. ſays that the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt ſubdues and enables the will of man to do that freely, and chearfully, which the will of God revealed in the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be done.</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> alſo ſaith frequently that the <hi>effectual will and grace of God doth not deſtroy, but eſtabliſheth the freedom of our actions,</hi> particularly in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Hoard,</hi> his <hi>God's Love to Mankind. Book</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 103. He writes thus againſt Mr. <hi>Maſon, when once God hath planted in us a principle of new Life, of the Life of Grace, by the Spirit of Regeneration,
<note place="margin">See 127 page <hi>of his Deſence of the Synod of</hi> Dort, &amp;c.</note> though all the powers thereof do incline only to that which is good, like as the powers of natural corruption, incline only unto evil; yet the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe and exerciſe of thoſe is always free: Like as the particular uſe and exerciſe of the powers of our Corruption is always free to the committing of this or that ſin according unto the emergent occaſions standing in congruity to every mans particular diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And pag. 104. <hi>Should he</hi> (Mr. Maſon) <hi>have laid to our charge that we maintain that God neceſſitates the will to any good act, and to over-rule the will therein, we ſhould ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny it without diſtinction. It is true, he over-rules the will of the fleſh, but not the will of the ſpirit, the Regenerate part, but moves it agreeably to its nature, and to work not only voluntarily, but</hi> freely <hi>whatſoever it worketh. For albeit the Regenerate part is like a moral vertue (though as much tranſcendent to it, as a thing ſupernatural tranſcends a thing natural) inclining only to that which is good, yet is it always moved to this particular good rather than to another moſt freely: Like as a mans natural Corruption inclines a man only to evil; yet to this kind of evil, or to this particular evil, rather than to that, Man is moved moſt freely: So that if we maintain not that God works a Man to every good act, otherwiſe than freely; let the very conſcience of our Enemies</hi> judge, whether we can maintain <hi>that God neceſſitates the will either of Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils unto ſin.</hi> And in the next page 105, he brings for confirmation of what he had ſaid, the 11th. Article of the Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where this poſition is firſt laid down, that God from all Eternity did by his Unchangeable Counſel ordain whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in time ſhould come to paſs; and then it is forthwith added, <q>That hereby no violence is offered to the Wills of the reaſonable Creatures, and neither the liberty nor the contingency of ſecond Cauſes is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then again in page 108. <hi>This is clearly our Doctrine (to wit that when God never ſo effectually works any Creature to the producing of an act connatural to it, yet he works the Creature thereunto agreeably to its Nature, that is, if it be a neceſſary agent, moves it to work neceſſarily; if it be a contingent agent, moves it to work contingently, and if it be a free agent, moves it to work freely) and in effect it is the Doctrine of all them who ſay that God determines the Will, as the</hi> Dominicans; <hi>or that God neceſſitates the Will as</hi> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin. <hi>For they acknowledge hereby that God moves the Creatures to work freely, in ſuch ſort,</hi> 
                  <q>That in the very act of working they might do otherwiſe, if they would.</q> They confeſs <hi>this providence of God is a great myſtery, and not ſufficiently comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by humane reaſon. Cajetan</hi> profeſſeth thus much as before alledged, <hi>and</hi> Alvarez <hi>maintaineth it in a ſet diſputation.</hi> Thus far <hi>Twiſs,</hi> whereby we ſee that he held all the good we do, to be acts of free Obedience, notwithſtanding that we produce them by the aſſiſtance of Gods effectual Grace, yea, that they are ſo free that though <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> in ſome reſpect it is neceſſary for them to be produced; yet <hi>ſimpliciter &amp; abſolutè,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See page 116, 117, 118, 119, 120.</note> ſimply and abſolutely it is poſſible for them not to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93177:40"/>And if our Actual Faith and Obedience be <hi>free acts of ours</hi> (notwithſtanding that they are alſo effects of God's Grace,) then they may be our <hi>Duties</hi> alſo: And indeed they are Duties ſo neceſſarily required of us, as that the obtaining of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Glorification is ſuſpended by the promiſes till the performance of them as was proved before: And then it follows by neceſſary conſequence that they are Evangelical Conditions of the promiſes; becauſe they have the Eſſential Nature of an Evangelical Condition.</p>
               <p>Here we take notice by the way that there are ſome who diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, and <hi>the adminiſtration</hi> of it, and they ſay <hi>themſelves,</hi> and would make all <hi>others</hi> ſay with them, that the <hi>Covenant it ſelf is abſolute to the Elect, but that the adminiſtration of it, is conditional in the preaching of the Goſpel.</hi>

                     <hi>A brief Account of the State of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences now depending and agitated about Juſtification,</hi> page 4.</note> Now we muſt declare that we cannot ſay without diſtinction (as ſome would have us to do) that <hi>the Covenant of Grace is abſolute to the Elect.</hi> We have already ſaid and proved that the Covenant of Grace made with the Church through Chriſt, is <hi>a complex of many promiſes,</hi> whereof <hi>ſome</hi> are indeed <hi>abſolute</hi> (yet not <hi>ſo abſolute</hi> neither <hi>as to exclude all uſe of means,</hi>) ſuch are the promiſes of the <hi>firſt Grace,</hi> of ſaving Faith and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>others</hi> of them are <hi>conditional</hi> even to the Elect, ſuch are the promiſes of the <hi>ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent bleſſings of the Covenant,</hi> as of <hi>Justification, pardon of ſin, and Eternal Life:</hi> We do not find that thoſe <hi>ſubſequent</hi> bleſſings of the Covenant are ever promiſed to any of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, but upon ſome <hi>Condition</hi> expreſſed or implyed; and moſt frequently the Conditions are <hi>expreſſed</hi> with a plain Declaration that <hi>as many as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the conditions, ſhall have the promiſed Bleſſings, but they who never perform the conditions, ſhall never have the promiſed bleſſings.</hi> This ſhows plainly that the Covenant it ſelf is <hi>conditional</hi> in reſpect of the ſaid <hi>ſubſequent</hi> bleſſings, becauſe it promiſeth them conditionally and not otherwiſe: And that which we ſee, is granted to us, that <hi>the adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, becauſe it is preached to all,</hi> (Elect and non-Elect) <hi>Conditionally;</hi> Affords us an irrefragable Argument to prove that it hath Conditions, and is conditional. For if the Covenant had no Condition at all with reſpect to the Elect, how could we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter and <hi>preach it conditionally</hi> with reſpect to them? If the Covenant which we adminiſter and preach to the Elect <hi>were abſolute to them,</hi> ſo as to have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and if yet notwithſtanding that, we ſhould <hi>preach and adminiſter the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them conditionally;</hi> our Adminiſtration and Preaching would not agree with the Nature of the object and thing which we Adminiſter and Preach, and ſo it would be <hi>fallacious</hi> and <hi>deceitful.</hi> The Covenant hath no <hi>Condition</hi> but is <hi>abſolute to the Elect,</hi> and yet muſt <hi>we tell them</hi> from the Lord that <hi>they muſt performe the condition of the Covenant-promiſe by believing and repenting,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> they ſhall have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed benefit of Juſtification and Pardon of ſin, but <hi>not otherwiſe?</hi> Would not this be to diſhonour God and abuſe his People both at once? To diſhonour God by taking his Name in vain, and preaching falſehood in his Name, and to abuſe his People by making them believe that <hi>the Covenant hath a Condition,</hi> and that they muſt <hi>performe it; otherwiſe they cannot be juſtified and ſaved,</hi> when at the ſame time <hi>we do not believe this our ſelves</hi> which we tell the People, but are perſwaded in our own minds that <hi>the Covenant is wholly abſolute to the Elect, and hath no condition at all.</hi> Either then as was ſaid before, we muſt not Adminiſter and Preach any part of the Covenant conditionally to the Elect, or there is and muſt be a Condition in the Covenant; and if there be a Condition in the Covenant, then we have what we aim at, for we deſire no more to prove the Covenant of Grace to be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and that it is not wholly abſolute to the Elect. The Truth is here ſo clearly on our ſide that we think our Brethren ſhould give Glory to God, and receive his Truth, without any farther <hi>wrangling</hi> oppoſition. As for the <hi>Authour</hi> with whom we have to do, though he ſeveral times expreſly denies <hi>Faith to be the condition of Juſtification,</hi> as page 8, 9, 25. Yet in page 24, where he affirms
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93177:40"/>
                  <hi>the Covenant to be abſolute, he grants that the offer of Chriſt, and of all his fulneſs hath a Condition annexed to it, that the Condition is acceptance of the Offer, and that acceptance is a native Condition.</hi> Here we have,</p>
               <p n="1">1. An offer of Chriſt, and of all his fulneſs, which muſt of neceſſity include <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> for that is a part of Chriſt's fulneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This offer of Chriſt is an <hi>abſolute</hi> offer, which yet hath <hi>the Condition of acceptance annexed to it.</hi> His meaning muſt be, that the offer of Chriſt, and his fulneſs, is ſo abſolute as to have <hi>no other Condition,</hi> but yet not ſo abſolute as not to have <hi>this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of acceptance; for if this be not his meaning it is <hi>contradictious Non-ſenſe.</hi> For an offer that is abſolute, <hi>without any Condition at all,</hi> and an offer that hath a <hi>certain Condition,</hi> implies a manifeſt contradiction. And indeed his Words are that it is an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute offer that hath no Condition in it but one.</hi> Well then, it is granted that the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offer of Chriſt, and of all his fulneſs hath <hi>one Condition,</hi> but ſo it is that that Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offer includes an offer of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Goſpel-offer of Juſtification hath a Condition;</hi> and ſince the <hi>offer of Juſtification</hi> can be nothing but the <hi>Promiſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> held forth to the Soul by the Miniſtry of the Word, it follows neceſſarily, that <hi>the Promiſe of Juſtification hath a Condition.</hi> And conſequently, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is partly <hi>conditional,</hi> it is <hi>conditional as it doth promiſe Juſtification upon a Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Condition is <hi>Acceptance,</hi> that is, it is <hi>Faith,</hi> for we cannot imagine, what elſe but <hi>Faith,</hi> he can mean by <hi>Acceptance:</hi> For ſurely he doth not mean any <hi>meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Act</hi> of the Soul, but rather ſome gracious, ſupernatural Act, and what that ſhould be but <hi>Faith,</hi> we cannot deviſe. We muſt therefore take it for certain, that by <hi>Acceptance</hi> he means <hi>Faith,</hi> and our Faith in Chriſt is our acceptance of him and his fulneſs. So then <hi>Faith being our Acceptance of Chriſt,</hi> and of all his fulneſs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes our Juſtification, and <hi>our Acceptance</hi> (by his own Confeſſion) being the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Offer,</hi> it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that <hi>Faith is the Condition of the Offer,</hi> but the <hi>Offer</hi> is the <hi>Covenant-promiſe</hi> of Chriſt, and Juſtification through him, therefore <hi>the Covenant-promiſe of Chriſt and Juſtification is conditional, and an accepting, or receiving Faith is the Condition of it.</hi> Thus he contradicts himſelf by affirming what he had denied before, and doth immediately deny, again in the very next 25th. Page.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This Acceptance,</hi> or Faith, this accepting Faith is (he ſayes) the <hi>native Condition</hi> of the Offer of Chriſt, and of all his fulneſs, and ſo of Juſtification. What he means by <hi>native</hi> Condition needs an Explication, for it is capable of a double meaning:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It may ſignify that an accepting Faith hath a <hi>natural aptitude and fitneſs</hi> to be the Condition of the Offer, or Promiſe, of Chriſt and his fulneſs. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>of its own Nature, it neceſſarily is the Condition, and could not poſſibly be otherwiſe;</hi> ſo that its being the Condition ariſeth <hi>wholly and neceſſarily from its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and not at all <hi>from the Will of God, conſtituting and ordaining</hi> it to that Office of being the Condition of the Offer or Promiſe. Now if he mean, that it is a <hi>native</hi> Condition in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe, we agree with him, for we know and acknowledge, that Faith hath a <hi>natural aptitude and fitneſs to be the Condition</hi> of the Offer or Promiſe of Chriſt, becauſe Faith, in the very Nature of it, is an acceptance of Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel; and we conceive this might be a Reaſon wherefore God made choice of Faith to be the Condition of the Offer and Promiſe of Chriſt, and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through him.</p>
               <p>But if our Authour moan, that Faith is the <hi>native</hi> Condition of the Offer or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſouſe, we muſt diſſent from him. For though the natural apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and fitneſs of Faith, might be a Reaſon why God ordained it to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe, yet it was not a <hi>neceſſitating Reaſon,</hi> which ſo <hi>obliged</hi> God to make it the Condition of the Promiſe, that <hi>he could not poſſibly do otherwiſe.</hi> This we thus demonſtrate,</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93177:41"/>
               <p n="1">1. Whatſoever dependeth upon the <hi>Free-will, and Soveraign Pleaſure of Almighty God, he might have done, or not have done, he might have done this way, or another way, if it had pleaſed him.</hi> This Propoſition is ſelf-evident, for it is of the very Eſſence <q>of Free-will in God, the Firſt and Freeſt Agent, that in all external temporal things, which fall under his Free-will, he might have done them, or not have done them, he might have done them thus as he doth them, or he might have done them otherwiſe than he hath done, if he had pleaſed.</q> 
                  <hi>But antecedently to his free Purpoſe and Decree, the whole ordering of the Covenant of Grace, and of its terms, and receptive Condition, depended upon God's Free-will, and Soveraign Pleaſure.</hi> Hence the Goſpel is called the Myſtery of <hi>God's Will,</hi> and the Revelation of the Goſpel unto us, is ſaid to be the making known unto us the Myſtery of <hi>his Will, according to his Good Pleaſure</hi> which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9. Now if the whole Myſtery of the Covenant of Grace depended on God's <hi>Free-will,</hi> then the ordaining of this, or that, to be the receptive Condition of the Covenant, depended on <hi>his Will</hi> alſo, and ſo antecedently to the free Purpoſe of his Will, there was no natural neceſſity that <hi>Faith</hi> alone, and no other thing, ſhould be the receptive Condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not yet paſt Diſpute amongſt Divines, Whether antecedently to God's free Purpoſe, and Decree to ſave us, by the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt alone, he <hi>might not have freely purpoſed and decreed to have pardoned and ſaved us ſome other way.</hi> Amongſt our Reformed Divines, <hi>Calvin, Twiſs,</hi> and <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> were of this Opinion, yea even Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> himſelf was once of this Opinion, (though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he changed his mind in that, as he did in other things,) witneſs what he wrote in his Book called, <hi>The Death of Death in the Death of Chriſt:</hi> Or, <hi>A Treatiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> &amp;c. Book II. Chap. II. Page 57. <hi>The Foundation of this whole Aſſertion ſeems to me to be falſe and erroneous,</hi> viz, <hi>that God could not have Mercy on Mankind, unleſs ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction were made by his Son: It is true indeed, ſuppoſing the Decree, Purpoſe, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of God, that ſo it ſhould be, that ſo he would manifeſt his Glory by the way of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Juſtice, it was impoſſible that it ſhould otherwiſe be, for with the Lord, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change, nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Lam. 1.18. 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>But to aſſert poſitively, that abſolutely and antecedently to his Conſtitution, he could not have done it, is to me an unwritten Tradition, the Scripture affirming no ſuch thing, neither can it be gathered from thence in any good conſequence, if any one ſhall deny this, we will try what the Lord will enable us to ſay unto it, and in the mean time reſt contented in that of</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>though other ways of ſaving us were not wanting to his Infinite Wiſdome, yet certainly the way which he did proceed in, was the moſt convenient, becauſe we find he proceeded therein.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in that Book; and though he <hi>unſaid</hi> this again, and embraced that Opinion, which he then called <hi>an unwritten Tradition;</hi> yet there are other Learned Divines of that ſame Opinion at this Day. Miſtake us not, for we do not ſay, that <hi>we are of it,</hi> but that <hi>ſome are,</hi> and that <hi>the matter is not yet paſt diſpute.</hi> And the Conſequence which we infer is undeniable, that if God antecedently to his Conſtitution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree could have pardoned and ſaved us ſome other way, without the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt, then ſurely he could have offered and promiſed us Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wation, without the Condition of Faith in Chriſt, and upon what other Condition he pleafed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though we grant, that upon ſuppoſition, that God would pardon our Sins, and ſave our Souls, it did not conſiſt with the Glory of his Juſtice, and Honour of his Law, and Government to do it, without Satisfaction for the Offence we had given, and the Diſhonour we had done him by our Sins; and therefore it was neceſſary not onely from the free purpoſe of God's Will, but alſo from the nature of his vindictive governing Juſtice, that Chriſt, by ſuffering in our ſtead, ſhould ſatisfie his Juſtice for our Sins, yet doth it not follow at all, by any <hi>natural neceſſity</hi> ariſing immediately from the <hi>eſſential nature of Faith without any appointment</hi> and conſtitution of God's Will, that Faith, becauſe it is of a <hi>receptive</hi> nature, and nothing elſe, ſhall be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the performance whereof, Chriſt with his Satisfaction and Merits ſhall be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93177:41"/>not only offered, but given unto us. For as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith very well, in his little Book <hi>of the Trinity and Satisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> pag. 208. <hi>The ſatisfaction made for Sin, being not made by the Sinner himſelf, there muſt of neceſſity be a Rule, Order, and Law-conſtitution, how the Sinner may come to be intereſted in it, and made Partaker of it; for the conſequent of the freedome of one by the ſuffering of another, is not matural, or neceſſary, but muſt proceed, and ariſe from a Law-conſtitution, Compact, and Agreement. Now the way conſtituted and appointed, is that of Faith, or believing, as explained in the Scripture.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> To which we add, that the Scripture explains it thus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>That in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> From this Paſſage of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and the Argument contained in it, it is moſt evident that it doth not ariſe <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> from the <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature of Faith,</hi> that it is the Condition of the Offer and Promiſe, but <hi>from the Will of God, conſtituting</hi> and <hi>appointing</hi> it to be the Condition. Faith's <hi>receptive appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive nature</hi> is but a <hi>remote</hi> Reaſon of its Conditionality, and doth but make it fit to be the Condition, if God pleaſe to make it ſo: And it is <hi>God's Will and Law-conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> onely, which is the <hi>neareſt</hi> and <hi>formal Reaſon</hi> of its Conditionality, and which doth <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> make it to be the Condition of the Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. This is no <hi>new</hi> notion of ours, we find it long agoe before many of us were born, <hi>Walaeus,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor of Divinity in <hi>Leyden,</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion Religionis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatae, pag.</hi> 112. ſaid that <hi>Fides nos Juſtificat, ſed relativè conſiderata, quia haec eſt Voluntas Dei: ut qui credit in Chriſtum, ejus meriti fiat Particeps: Faith Juſtifies us, but relatively conſidered, becauſe this is the Will of God, that he who believes in Chriſt ſhall be made Partaker of his Merit.</hi> And not onely Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> but <hi>Cartwright</hi> alſo, <hi>pag.</hi> 179. of his Book againſt <hi>Baxter,</hi> agrees with him in acknowledging this Truth; his Words are theſe, [<hi>The Reaſon why Chriſts Righteouſneſs cannot Juſtifie, except it be apprehended by Faith, is this, That God doth require Faith of us; Faith, I ſay, apprehending Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, (believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) that ſo we may be Juſtified.</hi> Gods Will <hi>is properly the cauſe, yet there is</hi> a congruity in the thing it ſelf, an aptitude <hi>(you grant) in the nature of Faith: It is of an apprehenſive nature, and its apprehending Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> (the Will of God <hi>ſtill preſuppoſed) doth make this Righteouſneſs ours, even as a Gift becomes ours by our receiving of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Worthy Divines, we ſee, were of our Opinion, That it is not <hi>the nature of Faith</hi> it ſelf, nor <hi>its relation unto Chriſt,</hi> which is eſſential to it, that doth <hi>formally</hi> make it to be the Inſtrumental Means, or Condition of our Juſtification, but it is <hi>the Will of God ordaining it to that Office.</hi> It is true, <hi>they</hi> held, and <hi>we</hi> with them hold, that there is a <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>fitneſs</hi> in Faith to be the receptive, and applicative Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promiſe, and of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs therein, becauſe it is of a receptive applicative nature, yet that doth not <hi>formally</hi> make it the Condition: For notwithſtanding its <hi>fitneſs</hi> to be the Condition, yet it would never have <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> been the Condition of Juſtification, nor would it ever have <hi>availed us to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> if God by an <hi>Act of his Free-will,</hi> had not <hi>made</hi> it the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Is not Juſtification a great Bleſſing and Benefit, which is in the power, and at the diſpoſal of God and Chriſt; and may not God <hi>do what he will with his own;</hi> may not he give his Bleſſing and Benefit upon what Terms and Conditions he and his Son ſhall think fit to agree upon? This ſurely is ſo evident, that no reaſonable Man can have reaſon to deny it. And then the conſequence is as evident, that it is <hi>not any thing intrinſecal to Faith, and ſo not its relation to Chriſt,</hi> which is intrinſecal to it, that can <hi>nextly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> make it the Inſtrumental Means, or Condition of Juſtification, but it is, and muſt be <hi>the Will of God,</hi> and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, agreeing that Faith ſhall be, and ordaining Faith to be the Inſtrumental Means, Terms, and Condition of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons we diſſent, and all Men that love the Truth ſhould diſſent from our Authour, if by ſaying that <hi>an accepting Faith is the native Condition of the Offer of Chriſt, and of all his fulneſs,</hi> he mean, That Faith <hi>of its own nature neceſſarily,</hi> is the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93177:42"/>condition of the promiſe, and could not poſſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> otherwiſe, ſo that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> being the condition doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>wholly</hi> ariſe from <hi>its own intrinſecal nature,</hi> and not at all from <hi>the Will</hi> of God and Chriſt conſtituting and ordaining it do that Office of being the Condition of the promiſe. We dare not uſcribe ſo much Vertue and Efficacy to the intrinſecal Nature of Faith in the matter of our Juſtification. But if by ſaying, That <hi>an accepting Faith is the Native condition of the offer of Chriſt and his fulneſs,</hi> our <hi>Authour</hi> means no more but this, That Faith being of a receptive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it hath <hi>a natural aptitude and fitneſs</hi> to be made the condition of the promiſe of Juſtification; and that that was a reaſon why it pleaſed God and Chriſt to <hi>make and conſtitute</hi> Faith to be the receptive condition of Juſtification, we ſhall not oppoſe; but join with him in this ſenſe of his words. But though we grant him for the reaſon aforeſaid, that Faith is <hi>the one native receptive</hi> condition of Juſtification; yet we can never grant that Faith taken in his ſenſe for <hi>the one ſingle Grace,</hi> (or it may be) for <hi>one ſingle Act of the one ſingle Grace of Faith,</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much leſs that it is the <hi>only</hi> condition of <hi>Glorification:</hi> For as Faith is the <hi>one,</hi> yea and <hi>only receptive</hi> condition, ſo <hi>true Repentance</hi> it the <hi>diſpoſitive condition</hi> of Juſtification, or of the Perſon to be juſtified in order to his Juſtification. And moreover Repontance is <hi>as native</hi> a condition in <hi>its kind</hi> as <hi>Faith in its kind;</hi> it is us native a <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> condition, as Faith is a native <hi>receptive</hi> condition. For ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance being a Godly ſorrow for having diſpleaſed and diſhonoured God, and a firm reſolution through Grace to do ſo no more, it doth from <hi>the very nature of the thing diſpoſe</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> the Soul for pardon, and then God hath likewiſe for that reaſon <hi>Willed, Ordained and Conſtituted</hi> Repentance to be the <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> Condition of pardon of Sin and Juſtification. As we proved before by plain teſtimonies of God's Holy Word. And though Faith and Repentance be <hi>equally neceſſary</hi> from the Will, Ordination, and Conſtitution of God and Chriſt; yet of the two, <hi>Repentance</hi> ſeems to be the <hi>moſt neceſſary</hi> with <hi>that kind of neceſſity</hi> which ariſeth preciſely from <hi>the nature of the thing:</hi> For it ſeems to be <hi>abſolutely impoſſible</hi> becauſe repugnant to the perfection of God's Holy Nature to Juſtifie, Pardon, and Love with a Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, a Rebellious Sinner, whilſt he is impenitent and continues his full Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to go on in his Rebellion, and Enmity againſt Heaven. The ſenſe of this Truth ſeems to have been much upon the very Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi>'s <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore it made him ſay in his Diſcourſe <hi>of free Grace,</hi> page 129, 130, 131. <hi>If the terms or conditions be ſuch, as it is not poſſible</hi> in the nature of the thing, <hi>that the mercy offered ſhould be effected without them; then the offers of ſaving mercies are</hi> as free and gracious as can be, as there is any poſſibility they ſhould be; <hi>and no more can be deſired.</hi> Then he takes <hi>Repentance</hi> for his inſtance; we do not ſay that he altogether <hi>excludes</hi> the other terms; but that <hi>Repentance</hi> is that which he <hi>Jingles out</hi> to inſtance in, and which he much inſiſts upon as taken in its Latitude. And thus he goes on <hi>Let me clear this in one of thoſe terms, which is comprehenſive of all the reſt. It is required of thoſe who will partake of Saving Mercies, that they leave ſin, forſake their evil ways. Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the ſumm of all Conditions; and whatever is required in other terms, is included in this, or may be reſolved into it. Now it is not poſſible that ſaving Mercies ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be had, that they ſhould be received or enjoyed, but upon theſe terms; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord would have it ſo,</hi> but becauſe the Nature of the thing doth ſo require it, that it is not otherwiſe feaſible, <hi>for ſin is our impotency: Now can we poſſibly have ſtrength in the inner man, if we will not part with our weakneſs? Sin is our deformity, that which renders our Souls loathſome and ugly in the eye of God. Now can our Souls be made lovely, if we will not part with that which is our defilement and uglineſs? Can we be made clean, if we will not part with our leproſie? Sin is our enmity againſt God, therein it conſiſts; now can we poſſibly be reconciled, if we will not lay aſide our enmity? —Sin is the wound, the mortal Diſeaſe of the Soul, and can you be healed, if you will not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93177:42"/>part with your Diſeaſe? Sin is your Miſery; and can you be happy, if not part with your miſery? Happyneſs conſiſts in the enjoyment of God; but adhering to ſin, and the enjoyment of a Holy God are utterly inconſiſtent: And can you be happy without happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or by retaining that which is inconſiſtent with it? So that you ſee there is an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impoſſibility that Salvation ſhould be had but upon theſe terms:</hi> There is an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, a plain contradiction, <hi>in any other ſuppoſition. It is an impoſſibility</hi> not only to us, but to the Almighty; <hi>and therefore the terms</hi> are as free and gracious, as poſſibly could be; <hi>Ommpotent Grace it ſelf could not make them more gracious;</hi> thus Mr. <hi>Clarkſon.</hi> Now let any Body of common underſtanding and honeſty read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this paſſage, and they will plainly ſee that he ſpeaks here of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and of Repentance not only as it denotes a Holy fruitful Life, and is the condition of conſummate Salvation and Glorification; but alſo as it denotes the Souls <hi>firſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from ſin</hi> and returning to God, and is the diſpoſing, preparing Condition of our firſt obtaining the Pardon of our Sins, and Juſtification and Reconciliation of our Perſons. And in both reſpects he holds Repentance to be a Condition indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary not only from <hi>the free Conſtitution and Ordination of God,</hi> but alſo from the very <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> ſo that God himſelf <hi>cannot diſpenſe</hi> with it. Now if this Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi>'s be true and good, then let the World judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Doctrine be not falſe and pernicious, which our Authour delivers in the 30 page of his Letter, That <hi>a real Change and Repentance is not antecedently neceſſary to Juſtification and Pardon of ſin.</hi> This indeed we affirm to be neceſſary, and he finds fault with us for it, and makes it to be a part of our <hi>New Scheme</hi> of Divinity, into which he foiſts ſincere <hi>Obedience,</hi> as if that alſo were a part of our new Scheme, That <hi>ſincere Obedience</hi> is antecedently neceſſary to Juſtification. But this is <hi>his calumny</hi> that we hold ſincere <hi>Obedience diſtinct from Faith and Repentance,</hi> to be antecedently neceſſary to Juſtification; all that know us and our Doctrine, know this to be falſe, and the contrary to be true, that in our Judgment <hi>ſincere Obedience is not neceſſary before,</hi> but <hi>after our Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>before our Gloriſication.</hi> As for a <hi>real Change,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> we do indeed believe and preach that they are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, indiſpenſably neceſſary in order of Nature at leaſt before our Juſtification and pardon of ſin; for a <hi>real change</hi> is wrought in us by <hi>effectual calling,</hi> and that is certainly before Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And Repentance is the diſpoſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification and the means to be uſed by us for obtaining the <hi>pardon of our ſins,</hi> which is an <hi>eſſential part</hi> of Juſtification. But ſo it is that the condition is in order of Nature before the thing conditionate, or the thing promiſed upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo the means is in execution before the end, therefore Repentance which is the Condition and Means is in order of Nature before Juſtification, which is the thing conditionate and the end. This we proved before both by Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſo doth Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> prove it in the paſſage we have now quoted, by two pertinent Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy;</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Surely one would gueſs by this, that Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> in his time was one of the Maſters in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with whom <hi>our Authour</hi> finds fault, <hi>page</hi> 15, of his Letter, for ſaying to a Man who asks them, <hi>What he muſt do to be ſaved,</hi> that he muſt <hi>repent and mourn for his known ſins, and leave and loath them, and God will have mercy on him;</hi> And moſt certainly if ever there were any ſuch Maſters in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> was one of them, for according to his Principles he muſt in that caſe have given a Man that anſwer, for he ſtrongly aſſerts that God Almighty <hi>cannot</hi> have Mercy upon, and pardon a wicked Man, unleſs he repent, mourn for his known ſins, leave and loath them.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93177:43"/>
               <p>But it would ſeem <hi>our Authour</hi> is ſuch a Crafts-Maſter, that he can <hi>teach a wicked. Man how to obtain the Mercy of God in the pardon of his ſins before, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of, mourning for, leaving and loathing of them;</hi> for he blames us for telling a wicked Man who comes to us for advice what he muſt do to be ſaved, that <hi>he muſt repent, mourn for, and turn from his ſins, and God will have mercy on him, and pardon him;</hi> now if this be <hi>bad Advice,</hi> then it plainly follows, that if the ſame wicked Man go to <hi>our Authour,</hi> and if he can give him better advice, <hi>he</hi> muſt ſhew him <hi>a way to obtain God's mercy in pardoning his ſins and ſaving his Soul; before and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his repenting of, mourning for, and turning from his ſins.</hi> But how can <hi>our Authour</hi> effect this, how can he teach a wicked Man to be ſaved from Sin and Wrath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance? Why he pretends this is eaſily done by giving the Man that ſame advice, which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. gave unto the Goaler, when he asked them what he ſhould do to be ſaved? And they ſaid to him, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe.</hi> This he ſays is an <hi>old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſo old, that with many it ſeems to be out of date,</hi> page 14, and it is the <hi>right Anſwer.</hi> For ſays he, page 15, <hi>Why ſhould not</hi> the right Anſwer <hi>be given, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall be ſaved.</hi> By this it is evident that he ſets theſe two Anſwers <hi>in oppoſition</hi> the one to the other, as <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> and makes, <hi>(Repent, and God will have mercy on you)</hi> to be the <hi>wrong Anſwer:</hi> And, (<hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall</hi> be ſaved) to be the <hi>right</hi> Anſwer. And now is not he a wiſe Maſter in our <hi>Iſrael</hi> who talks thus! If he had only talkt thus to his <hi>ſilly</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes in a private corner, though we had been credibly informed of it, we ſhould not have eaſily believed it, or if the evidence had been ſuch, as we could not chooſe but believe it, yet we ſhould not have wondred ſo much at the matter; but that he ſhould appear <hi>in print</hi> with <hi>ſuch ſtuff,</hi> that he ſhould appear on the Theatre of the World in the face of the Sun, and tell a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe People that a <hi>wicked</hi> man who asks Miniſters <hi>what he muſt do to be ſaved,</hi> muſt <hi>not</hi> be taught to <hi>repent</hi> of his ſins, but to <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt that he may be ſaved, (as if theſe two things were <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> the one being <hi>right,</hi> and the other <hi>wrong),</hi> It cannot but move us to admiration of his ſtrange confidence, to an indignation at <hi>his groſs ignorance,</hi> or vile <hi>hypocriſie;</hi> and to a tender compaſſion towards thoſe poor Souls whoſe lot it is to be led into the Ditch by ſuch <hi>blind guides.</hi> But good Sir, how doth it appear that <hi>our</hi> anſwer is <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>yours</hi> only is <hi>right?</hi> Why <hi>may</hi> not <hi>both be right,</hi> and why <hi>muſt not both be right,</hi> and both <hi>concur</hi> to make up <hi>one entire anſwer, and full advice</hi> to a wicked man who under Conviction comes and asks Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, what he muſt do to be ſaved? If you had behaved your ſelf in this matter like a <hi>fair</hi> adverſary or an <hi>honeſt. Man,</hi> you had given in our anſwer <hi>fully</hi> without curtailing it; for you <hi>know in your conſcience</hi> that in ſuch a caſe our <hi>full</hi> Anſwer and Advice to a Man is, that he muſt do <hi>both,</hi> he muſt both <hi>believe</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>repent</hi> of, mourn for and turn from his Sins. The Conſcience of Truth extorted this Confeſſion from you in your appendix, <hi>page</hi> 41. as we obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That <hi>your hotteſt oppoſers would freely tell ſuch a man that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> Why did not you then (if you be an <hi>honeſt man</hi>) give in our <hi>full anſwer,</hi> and refute it, if you thought it was <hi>wrong?</hi> If you ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> did not give ſuch a <hi>full</hi> anſwer and advice to the Goaler, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. but bid him <hi>believe</hi> only <hi>in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and thereupon promiſed him Salvation, <hi>without adviſing him to repent</hi> and turn from his ſins. We anſwer, It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Goaler <hi>believe</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but it is utterly falſe that he bid him <hi>only believe,</hi> there is no ſuch excluſive particle in the Text, and though the Sacred Hiſtorian <hi>Luke</hi> mention not expreſly that <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Goaler <hi>repent,</hi> yet it doth by no means follow that, becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> doth not <hi>ſay expreſly</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Goaler repent, therefore <hi>he did not bid</hi> him, for it was never <hi>Lukes</hi> intention to ſet down in his Hiſtory <hi>every Word or Sentence</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> at any time ſpoke to the People. Nay
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93177:43"/>in the very next verſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.32. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays that <hi>Paul and Silas ſpake unto the Goaler the Word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe;</hi> but he doth not tell us particularly what that Word was: Nor doth <hi>our Authour</hi> know, nor can he with a good Conſcience ſay that it was not an Advice and Exhortation to <hi>repent,</hi> to mourn for his known ſins, and to leave and loath them, aſſuring him that thereupon God would have mercy on him, and pardon his ſins, and ſave his Soul for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt's ſake. If <hi>our Authour</hi> ſay that as he cannot be ſure of the <hi>negative</hi> that he did not, ſo we cannot be ſure of the <hi>affirmative</hi> that he did preach the neceſſity of <hi>Repentance</hi> to the Goaler. We anſwer that we can prove, and do thus prove the affirmative.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe it was a part of the Apoſtles Commiſſion to preach <hi>Repentance</hi> unto all People, as well as <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt; for which ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. compared with <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.47, 48. But <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, therefore he acted according to the Apoſtolical Commiſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> baptized or cauſed the Goaler to be baptized, and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Repentance ſhould be preached to him, and profeſſed by him, before ſuch an one as he, were admitted to Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf tells us (as his words are recorded by the <hi>Sacred</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Luke</hi>) that it was his common Practice to preach <hi>Repentance,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith</hi> unto all thoſe whom he Converted, or intended and endeavoured to convert unto the Chriſtian Religion. Thus did he at <hi>Lystra, Acts</hi> 14.15. <hi>He exhorted the people to turn from their vanities unto the living God which made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo at <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. He commanded them all from the Lord to <hi>repent,</hi> and perſwaded them ſo to do, by a moſt powerful Motive and Argument taken from God's being Rector and Judge of the World, and from his having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, in which he will <hi>judge the world in righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and will then juſtifie or condemn, reward, or puniſh every man <hi>according to their works,</hi> and this he aſſured them of by an Argument taken from Chriſt's Reſurrection from the dead. Again in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. he tells us, That <hi>Repentance towards God and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus,</hi> were the ſum and ſubſtance of his Sermons; theſe were the two ſubjects that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ordinarily preached upon both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And laſtly in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20, 22, 23. we read that he declared openly to Ring <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that from the firſt time he was miraculouſly called to be an Apoſtle, his buſineſs had been to preach Repentance and Faith. From all which we conclude that we have good reaſon to believe and aſſert the <hi>affirmative</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach, <hi>Faith only,</hi> but that he preached <hi>Repentance</hi> alſo to the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and withal we <hi>challenge</hi> and <hi>defie</hi> our Authour to prove the Negative that <hi>Paul</hi> preached not the neceſſity of <hi>Repentance,</hi> but of <hi>Faith only</hi> in order to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>But ſaith our Authour, page 15. <hi>No wit or art of man will ever find a crack or flaw in, or deviſe another, or a better anſwer than Pauls to the Goaler, believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> We Reply, It is far from the thoughts of any of us, or of any good Chriſtian to find fault with, or to go about to mend <hi>Paul</hi>'s Anſwer to the Goalers queſtion, all that we ſay is that his <hi>whole anſwer</hi> is not ſet down expreſly by the Hiſtorian <hi>Luke,</hi> and we have proved it. A <hi>truer</hi> Anſwer cannot indeed be given than it was, but a <hi>fuller</hi> may be given, and we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it was given by <hi>Paul,</hi> though not particularly <hi>expreſſed</hi> by <hi>Luke.</hi> This may ſatisfie any reaſonable Man, for we are ſure it cannot be confuted. Yet for the farther ſatisfaction of all Men (if poſſible), we will here tranſeribe and ſet down a paſſage of Mr. <hi>Venning,</hi> a famous Congregational Miniſter once in this City; It is in his Sermon called <hi>the way to true happyneſs</hi> preached before the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen January</hi> 28. 1654/5, on <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. <hi>page</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>I ground it further</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>on this Rule which is an undeniable one, and for not attending whereunto, we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93177:44"/>have had ſo many needleſs, groundleſs, and unprofitable diſputes in the World. The Rule is this,</hi> That the Scripture doth often, yea, very uſually put particular Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for all Religion, and therefore annexeth Salvation to diſtinct Graces. <hi>Sometimes it is,</hi> he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved; <hi>Elſewhere</hi> he that calleth upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved: <hi>Here it is,</hi> He that doth the will of God. <hi>Now all theſe and the like are complex and comprehenſive propoſitions, and contain more in them than they make ſhew of (for God ſpeaks much in a little,) Acts and Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being (as Moraliſts ſpeak of their Vertues,</hi> inter ſe connexae) <hi>linked together in a Golden Chain. Religion is not this or that piece, but the whole, which is uſually expreſſed in a word, or ſometimes two,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21, 27. <hi>compared, the Apoſtle comprehends the whole counſel of God under</hi> Repentance and Faith; <hi>alſo in that of Solomon,</hi> Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole of Man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>So that if you could ſuppoſe a Man to be a Believer, and to be</hi> a Believer alone, <hi>it would not ſave him, as the Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>ſaith, chap.</hi> 2.14. What doth it profit my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works, can faith ſave him? <hi>No, no more than</hi> ſaying, be ye warmed, will warm any; or be ye filled, will fill any; for Faith without works is dead. <hi>And what is ſaid of this, may be ſaid of the reſt, ſo that when the Scripture ſpeaks of Salvation, as annexed to any one thing, it ſuppoſeth that to contain the reſt: The reaſon is evident, for the Graces of God, as ſaving, are not parted. There is no belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Salvation without Repentance, nor no Repentance to Salvation without believing; there is no calling upon the Name of the Lord will ſave, without departing from iniquity; nor can they ſavingly depart from iniquity, that call not on the Name of the Lord. It is not any</hi> one thing, <hi>but</hi> things <hi>that pertain to the Kingdom of God, Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>It is</hi> not thing but things <hi>that accompany, (or as it may be better read, contain) Salvation, Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And he that takes one for all without all,</hi> (as our wiſe Authour doth,) <hi>will find nothing at all. A part is no portion.</hi> 
                  <q>The great fallacy with which Satan deludes many men, is that which Logicians call <hi>à benè compoſitis ad malè diviſa;</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>When he gets them to take Religion into pieces, and then take</hi> one piece for Religion. <hi>One cries up</hi> God, <hi>another cries up</hi> Chriſt, <hi>another</hi> Faith, <hi>another</hi> Love, <hi>another</hi> good Works; <hi>but what is</hi> God without Chriſt, <hi>or</hi> Chriſt without Faith, <hi>or</hi> Faith without Love, <hi>or</hi> Love without Works? <hi>But now</hi> take God in Chriſt, by Faith which worketh by Love to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Commandments of God, <hi>and this is pure Religion. It is the whole, that is the whole of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet again, though I have ſpoken thus much to it, let me make it clearer than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, That</hi> one is put for all, and as containing all, <hi>by comparing theſe places of Scripture;</hi> In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>You read that</hi> circumciſion is nothing, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is nothing, but keeping the Commandments of God? <hi>What's that? Why</hi> that is all in all. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>It is neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but Faith which worketh by Love: That's that which availeth, or is all in all. Yet in Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a new Creature: <hi>That's all in all. And yet for all this, as if all this were nothing, he tells us, in</hi> Col. 3.11. That Chriſt is all and in all, <hi>caſhiering both circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and uncircumciſion, as formerly. Now, my beloved, if you ſhould take any one of theſe, though each be ſaid to be availing, I ſay if you ſhould take any one, and lay the ſtreſs of your Salvation upon it; you were undone.</hi> (Let <hi>our Authour</hi> and his Proſelytes look to themſelves.) <hi>It is not keeping the Commandments of God, nor Faith working by Love, nor the new Creature, no nor Chriſt himſelf conſidered</hi> alone and apart <hi>that availeth any thing, but theſe in conjunction. He names</hi> one onely, <hi>becauſe where one is, it is not</hi> only one, <hi>there is more than one; wherever one is ſavingly, there are</hi> all <hi>in their reſpective places, as far as they are to be in relation to Salvation. Thus you ſee, that</hi> Faith <hi>as well as</hi> Works, <hi>and</hi> Works <hi>as well</hi> as <hi>Faith (every one in their own order) are to be taken in, or we ſhall not be taken into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93177:44"/>
               <p>This Rule of interpreting Scripture is one of <hi>Vennings things that are well worth the thinking on,</hi> and therefore we have ſet it down at large. If it be duly attended to, it will give light ſufficient to diſcover the darkneſs of our <hi>Authours Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he objects further, That <hi>no anſwer but this alone, can rightly heal the wound of an awakened Conſcience, pag.</hi> 15. We reply, That what he ſays is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>deluſive</hi> in his ſenſe, taking Faith for <hi>one ſingle act of one Grace</hi> and Duty <hi>excluſive of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and all other Graces and Duties: But take it according to God's uſual way of ſpeaking much in a little, and in a complex comprehenſive ſenſe, as taking in, or not excluding, but rather <hi>ſuppoſing Repentance,</hi> and it is moſt true: For <hi>the Vertue and Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood applyed by the Spirit and Faith to the Soul prepared by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is indeed the only Remedy that can heal it.</hi> But if <hi>our Authour</hi> will ſay that <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> and <hi>without Repentance</hi> will <hi>heal the wounds of awakened conſciences</hi> in wicked Men at their firſt Converſion; we cannot chooſe but rank him amongſt thoſe <hi>Covetous, deceitful Prophets and Prieſts,</hi> who <hi>heal the hurt of the People ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace. Jerem.</hi> 6.13, 14.</p>
               <p>We are infallibly ſure from the Scriptures of Truth, That the Apoſtles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was to preach <hi>Repentance</hi> as well as <hi>Faith</hi> in order to Mens Juſtification and Salvation; and that they were obedient to the Commands of their Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord, and preached according to their Commiſſion. For we read in God's Holy Word, that when the Conſciences of a multitude of unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> (who had been acceſſory to the moſt barbarous murder of Chriſt the Son of God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Men) were throughly awakened, and their Spirits were deeply wounded by the Arrows of Conviction which Almighty God by his Word and Spirit had ſhot into their Souls, they feeling themſelves <hi>pricked in their hearts, ſaid unto Peter, and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren what ſhall we do? Acts</hi> 2.37. then as follows, verſ. 38. <hi>Peter ſaid unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we have a Company of People in great diſtreſs of Conſcience, as the Goaler was; and in this their Spiritual diſtreſs, they do as the Goaler did. As the Goaler ſought advice of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and asked them, <hi>what he ſhould do to be ſaved;</hi> Juſt ſo the awakened convinced <hi>Jews</hi> ſought advice of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, and asked them, <hi>What they ſhould do:</hi> To whom <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Repent and be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon we demand of our Authour, was this anſwer of <hi>Peter, a right</hi> anſwer or not?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) We hope he will not, he dare not ſay it was <hi>not a right anſwer;</hi> For <hi>Peter</hi> was an Apoſtle as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> and at that very time he was <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpake as he was inſpired</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt: If then he ſhould be ſo bold as to ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> did not give them a <hi>right anſwer,</hi> becauſe he did not ſay to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Goaler, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall be</hi> ſaved: He would not only give <hi>Peter,</hi> but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the <hi>lye,</hi> and might juſtly expect that the Lord would confound him. Therefore we do not think that he will be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as to ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> did not give the Men a right Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If he ſay that <hi>it was a right Anſwer,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> gave them, then in effect he gives <hi>himſelf the lye,</hi> he condemns himſelf, and juſtifies us. For it is the ſame Anſwer upon the matter which we give unto the Sinner that comes to us for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which <hi>Peter</hi> gave unto the convinced <hi>Jews. Peter</hi> bid them <hi>repent and be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> We bid him, <hi>repent</hi> of, mourn for, and turn from his Sins, and God will have Mercy on him for Chriſt's ſake, and <hi>if the man be unbaptized</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; we bid him <hi>be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> did by thoſe <hi>Jews.</hi> Whatever therefore <hi>our Authour</hi> hath ſaid againſt <hi>us</hi> in this matter, he hath ſaid againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> and which is more, <hi>againſt the Holy Spirit</hi> himſelf. If <hi>our</hi> Anſwer be <hi>wrong,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi>'s was wrong before us, and he it was that deceived us, for we have ours from him, and from God by him.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93177:45"/>
               <p>If <hi>Peter</hi>'s Anſwer was <hi>right,</hi> then <hi>ours is right</hi> likewiſe, for ours is <hi>the ſame</hi> with his exactly, if the Perſon be unbaptized, excepting that upon his Repentance, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for the remiſſion of ſius, we do not promiſe him the miraculous, extraordinary Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> promiſed thoſe Jews, but onely the ordinary Gift which is common to all true penitent Believers, in all Ages. If <hi>our Authour</hi> ſay, that <hi>implicitely Peter</hi> bid them believe in Chriſt, as well as repent, by bidding them to be baptized in his Name. Moſt true, and ſo do we; nay which is more, whether the Perſon be baptized, or unbaptized, when we exhort him to repent, we never fail to exhort him alſo, and that <hi>explicitely,</hi> and in <hi>formal expreſs terms,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, us <hi>Paul</hi> did by the Jaiſour. Where is the Fault then of our Anſwer taken <hi>fully and fairly</hi> as we give it? Certainly no where, unleſs <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Anſwers were both faulty, for our Anſwer comprehends <hi>both theirs,</hi> and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame, ſo far as the different Circumſtances of the Perſons and Times will admit. Let our Authour then look to it, that by his writing thus againſt us he be not found fighting againſt God, and the Holy Apoſtles of Chriſt our Saviour.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid we have made it ſufficiently evident, that the Covenant of Grace is not <hi>abſolute,</hi> but <hi>conditional,</hi> with reſpect to its ſubſequent Bleſſing and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; for we have proved it, both by clear Scripture and Reaſon. We have ſhewed alſo, that our Authour's <hi>own Conſcience</hi> could not altogether deny it, and therefore he grants, that <hi>an accepting Faith is the native Condition of it:</hi> How far, and in what ſenſe this is true, we have ſhewed at large, and withal, we have proved, that though Faith be the <hi>one native, receptive, applicative</hi> Condition of Juſtification, yet is it <hi>not the only Condition</hi> abſolutely, but the only <hi>receptive</hi> Condition, with which it is very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, that <hi>Repentance</hi> be the <hi>diſpoſitive Condition,</hi> which it really is, and that as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and neceſſarily, in its kind and order, as Faith can be in its kind and order.</p>
               <p>It remains now, that having proved the Covenants Conditionality by Scripture and Reaſon, we ſhew in the third and laſt place, by Teſtimonies of Divines, Antient and Modern, even of thoſe very Divines whom <hi>our Authour</hi> affirms to be againſt us, that they believed the Covenant to be conditional in the ſame ſenſe as we do, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that <hi>our Authour</hi> has fouly <hi>belyed</hi> us in telling the People, that we have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>a new Divinity, corrupt the old, and preach a new Goſpel.</hi> And,</p>

               <p>This Teſtimony of <hi>Clement,</hi> with what follows there, ſhews plainly, that God hath
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93177:45"/>made Repentance neceſſary, antecedently in order of Nature unto Pardon of ſin, and that upon Condition of Repentance he hath promiſed Pardon of ſin unto all, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Blood of Chriſt, ſhed for the remiſſion of ſin.

And this we take to be the true meaning of <hi>Clement</hi>'s Words. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This is a Grace and Favour <hi>common unto all Men</hi> by the Law of Chriſt, that they are admitted to Repentance, as a means of obtaining Pardon through his Blood; which the Law of Works and Innocency did not admit, but required a moſt perfect, perſonal, never-ſinning Obedience, as abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary to Life and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This is a Grace and Favour which is really <hi>offered</hi> unto all the World, that hear the joyful ſound of the Goſpel; that if they ſincerely repent of their ſins, they ſhall be pardoned and ſaved for the ſake of Chriſt, who ſhed his moſt precious Blood for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The very ſame Words,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are uſed in this ſame ſenſe by <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Third Book againſt <hi>Celſus, Cambridge</hi> Edition, pag. 154.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God grants the Grace of Repentance, i. e.</hi> the Gracious Bleſſing and Priviledge which is obtained by Repentance, to wit, pardon of ſin. This is, and muſt be, the ſenſe of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Words there, and they can have no other. For <hi>Origen</hi> affirms there, in oppoſition to the Calumny of <hi>Celſus,</hi> (as ſhall be ſhewed by and by) that Men muſt firſt be truly penitent, they muſt be inwardly changed, and converted from Evil to Good, before God be merciful to them, ſo as to pardon their ſins: And when they are ſo wrought upon, as to be really changed, converted, and become truly penitent, then
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God grants them the Grace of Repentance, that is, the pardon of their ſins, which is the gracious Benefit annexed to Repentance, and promiſed to all, upon Condition, that they truly repent. To put another ſenſe on <hi>Origen</hi>'s Words, would be to make Non-ſenſe of them, and to make him ſay, That if Men be firſt truly penitent, God will afterwards give them Grace, whereby they may be (or are) made truly penitent. <hi>Origen</hi> was not ſuch a filly Man, as to write thus fooliſhly for the Chriſtian Religion againſt a learned and malitious Heathen.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi>'s
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Grace of Repentance,</hi> is the ſame thing with <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Fructus Paenitentiae, Fruit of Repentance;</hi> but <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Fruit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is pardon of ſin; for ſo he writes <hi>Lib. de Pudicitiâ, Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Ita ceſſatio delicti radiae est veniae, ut venia ſit paenitentiae fructus; Ceaſing from ſin is ſo the root of pardon, that pardon is the fruit of repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) And Laſtly, the Words-which immediately follow in <hi>Clement,</hi> ſhew this to be his meaning, for he adds, <hi>Let us take a diligent view of all Generations, and learn, that in every Generation, the Lord hath given place of Repentance to ſuch as were willing to turn unto him.</hi> Noah <hi>preached Repentance, and they that obeyed, were ſaved;</hi> Jonah <hi>preached Deſtruction to the</hi> Ninivites, <hi>but they repenting them of their ſins, appeaſed God by their humble Supplications, and were preſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Words plainly ſhew, that by ſaying, that through the Blood of Chriſt, ſhed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93177:46"/>for our Salvation, God hath <hi>offered the Grace of Repentance to the whole World, Clement</hi> meant, that God hath admitted all Men to Repentance, as <hi>the way and means to obtain Pardon,</hi> and hath promiſed, and according to his Promiſe doth give them Pardon, for Chriſt's ſake, upon their Repentance.</p>
               <p>But it may be, ſome will Object, that yet the ſame <hi>Clement,</hi> in the ſame Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, pag. 67. <hi>They</hi> (the Holy Men before, and under the Law) <hi>were all Glorified and made Great, not by themſelves, or by their own Works; or by the juſt Actions which they did, but by his Will. So we</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>then, being called in Chriſt Jeſus by his Will, are not juſtified by our ſelves, nor by our own wiſdome, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or piety, or by the works which we have done in holineſs of heart; but by Faith, whereby the Almighty God hath Juſtified all Men from the beginning of the World, to whom he Glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen. We Anſwer, that this makes nothing againſt us, for we have believed we do, and through Grace, will always believe, that God Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies us by Faith, and not by <hi>any Works diſtinct from Faith,</hi> in the ſenſe before explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that is, that God, of his own Gracious Will and Pleaſure, hath ordained <hi>Faith</hi> to be the only <hi>receptive,</hi> applicative Condition, Means, or federal, moral Inſtrument of Juſtification, upon our performing of which Condition, or uſing of which Means and Inſtrument, God doth freely juſtifie us for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt's ſatisſactory, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Righteouſneſs onely.</hi> We do indeed with <hi>Clement,</hi> and with the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles believe, that ſincere Repentance is pre-required, as a <hi>diſpoſitive Condition</hi> to our obtaining of Juſtification; yet we do not ſay any more than they did, that we are <hi>Juſtified by Repentance; but together with them we ſay, that we are Juſtified by Faith only,</hi> becauſe God hath appointed <hi>Faith onely</hi> to that Office of being the receptive Condition, and inward, applicative Means of Juſtifiaation through Chriſt's Blood: <hi>Clemeut</hi>'s ſaying, that God Juſtifies us <hi>by Faith, and not by Works,</hi> muſt undoubtedly be underſtood in this ſenſe, as appears by what we have quoted, and ſhall now further quote out of him. Pag. 102.

               <p>And as he held <hi>Faith and Repentance together</hi> to be indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of Juſtification, and pardon of ſin, ſo he held <hi>ſincere Obedience,</hi> in a courſe of holy living, to be indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of <hi>Glorification and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation.</hi> For thus he writes, pag. 61, 62.

For the Scripture ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. As in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. which <hi>Clement</hi> quotes from <hi>v.</hi> 16. to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93177:46"/>end. And then he proceeds, ſaying, <hi>(This is the way, Beloved, wherein we find Jeſus Chriſt, our ſaving health, the High Prieſt of our Offerings, the Guardian and Helper of our weakneſs.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, In Page 102, 105, 106. <hi>He that hath Love in Chriſt, let him keep the Commandments of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>Bleſſed are we, Beloved, if we have done the Commandments of God, in the Concord of Love;</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that through Love our Sins may be forgiven us. For it is written, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered. Bleſſed is the Man unto whom the Lord imputeth not ſin, neither is there guile in his mouth. This Bleſſedneſs hath been unto thoſe who were choſen by God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen. Thus <hi>Clement;</hi> who was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Fellow-Labourer, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3.) and who may well be preſumed to know his Mind, as to theſe Matters; and we ſee evidently by his Words, that he held (as we do) that <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> are both antecedently neceſſary to Juſtification and pardon of ſin, and further, that ſincere <hi>Obedience</hi> to Chriſt's Commandments; in a courſe of holy living, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to the obtaining of Eternal Life and Glory in the Everlaſting Kingdome of our moſt Glorious God and Saviour. But ſome may poſſibly ſay, what did <hi>Clement</hi> mean by writing as he doth, that <hi>our ſins are forgiven us through Love?</hi> Is that an Orthodox Expreſſion? We Anſwer, What did our Saviour mean by ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> And again, what did our Saviour mean by ſaying, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.25. <hi>When ye ſtand praying, forgive, if ye have ought againſt any: that your Father alſo which is in Heaven, may forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> Were theſe Orthodox Expreſſions? If they were Orthodox, as doubtleſs they were, and it were Blaſphemy to think otherwiſe; then ſo is the expreſſion of <hi>Clement</hi> Orthodox, for the Expreſſions are alike upon the matter, and the meaning is the ſame. <hi>Clement</hi> by ſaying, that <hi>our ſins are forgiven through Love,</hi> meant no more, but that our forgiving our Neighbour his Treſpaſſes againſt us, (which is an Act of Love;) is a <hi>Means</hi> of God's appointment, whereby we obtain the forgiveneſs of our ſins from God through Chriſt. We do not doubt, but this was <hi>Clement</hi>'s meaning; and we are ſure it was our Saviours: When he ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.25. <hi>If ye have ought againſt any forgive, that your Father alſo, which is in Heaven, may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord, who is the faithful Witneſs, makes God's forgiving us to be the <hi>End,</hi> and our forgiving our Neighbour to be a <hi>Means</hi> indiſpenſably neceſſary to be uſed by us for obtaining that End. So that we obtain the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſins <hi>through Love,</hi> in a very ſound and Orthodox ſenſe; even as ſound and Orthodox as Chriſt's Goſpel is.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place we bring the foreſaid Teſtimony of <hi>Origen</hi> to prove, that <hi>the real change</hi> which is wrought in the Soul by a ſincere Repentance, is antecedently neceſſary to diſpoſe and prepare us for obtaining the promiſed Bleſſing of Pardon of ſin, which is an eſſential part of Juſtification. It is in his Third Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Edition, pag. 154. The Paſſage in <hi>Origen</hi> begins thus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which we will give the ſenſe of, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the uſe of <hi>our Authour. After theſe things</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> which had been objected and anſwered before) <hi>he</hi> (Celſus) <hi>takes upon him to charge us with that which is not granted by the more rational, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Believers, though perhaps it may be thought ſo, by ſome fooliſh, or ignorant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that as ſome Men are overcome by, and under the Dominion of a tender, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, natural frame and temper of Mind, ſo God being overcome by, and under the power of a merciful, compaſſionate nature towards them that are in miſery, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and pardons miſerable Men, though they be wicked, if withal they be of a pitiful

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> But though they be otherwiſe good men, yet God rejects them if they be not of ſuch a pitiful, compaſſionate Nature: Which is moſt unjuſt. For according to our Faith God doth not relieve, ſo as to pardon and receive into his Favour any wicked Man, unleſs he be firſt turned unto virtue, (that is, converted;) like as he doth not reject any, that is now become a good Man. But neither doth he relieve, or ſhew mercy unto any Man of a merciful Nature, meerly becauſe he is of a merciful Nature, taking the word</hi> (Mercy) <hi>in the ſenſe that the vulgar, or common People, uſe it in; but thoſe that greatly condemn themſelves for their ſins, ſo as thereupon to mourn and bewail themſelves as loſt and undone by reaſon of the evil they have done; and withal give evidence of a ſignal change, ſuch as becomes true Penitents, God grants to them</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the Grace of Repentance,</hi> (that is, the Gracious Fruit, and Benefit promiſed to Repentance,) <hi>even to them who have</hi> changed their moſt wicked courſe. <hi>For unto ſuch is given (as by Act of Oblivion) a pardon of their paſt ſins, through the vertue that comes to dwell in their Souls, and caſts out the vice and corruption that poſſeſſed them before. Or if at firſt they attain not unto a confirmed habit of vertue, yet there is a notable</hi> change in the Soul, <hi>which proceeds ſo far, as that it is ſufficient, according to the proportion of it, to purge out, and take away the great abundance of wickedneſs that was in it before, ſo as it can hardly ever get into the Soul again.</hi> Thus far <hi>Origen.</hi> In which Teſtimony of his there are ſeveral things worthy of our obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Origen</hi> did not write this meerly as a <hi>private</hi> Chriſtian, or Teacher of the Church, declaring what was his own private Opinion, but as the great, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Apologiſt</hi> in his time for Chriſt, the Chriſtian Church, and for the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, againſt the <hi>Heatheus,</hi> particularly againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> a very learned <hi>Heathen,</hi> who had written learnedly and ſpitefully againſt Chriſt, and againſt Chriſtians, and the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas <hi>Celſus</hi> had charged Chriſtians with an abſurd, impious Opinion, as that they believed, That God pardoneth wicked Mens ſins, and receives them into his Favour, if they be of a good Nature, of a ſoft, pitiful, compaſſionate Temper, <hi>before there paſs a real change</hi> upon them, before they <hi>repent,</hi> before they turn from ſin, and return unto God in Heart and Affection; <hi>Origen</hi> deuyed the Charge, and affirmed, that no rational, intelligent, judicious Chriſtian believed any ſuch thing; that if any Chriſtian did at all believe, that God juſtified and pardoned a wicked Man <hi>before he had repented</hi> of his ſins, and returned unto the Lord, they muſt be <hi>ſome fooliſh, ſimple, ignorant</hi> People; and yet he would not abſolutely grant to his Adverſary, that there were then any ſuch fooliſh, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Chriſtians in the World; but in regard he was not acquainted with every individual Chriſtian, he did not abſolutely deny it, only he ſaid,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>perhaps</hi> there might be ſome ſuch Chriſtians in the World: And if there were (as there might be, or not be ſome, for ought he knew,) they were none of the right breed of Chriſtians, they were but
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>fooliſh, ignorant</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Origen</hi> acknowledges that that ſenſeleſs Opinion did impute unto the Holy God, a thing that is (<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore in the Name of the Chriſtian Church he declares to <hi>Celſus,</hi> That Chriſtians believed, that God pardons, and receives into Favour <hi>no unconverted, impenitent Man,</hi> and that he rejects no good Man, no penitent Believer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He declares, that according to the Faith of Chriſtians, a Man muſt always (<hi>repent before God pardon</hi> him, and receive him into his Favour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Repentance, which goes before Pardon, and to which pardon is promiſed, muſt be ſuch as makes a <hi>real change</hi> in a Man's Heart and Soul, and that the change is ſo great, as that the Man greatly condemns himſelf on the account of his ſins, he mourns for them, and turns from them unto the Lord in Heart and Affection, yea it is ſo great, as that the <hi>reigning power</hi> of ſin is in a good meaſure broken, and it is caſt down from its Throne in the Heart.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Origen</hi> declares, that if the Gracious Principle that comes to take poſſeſſion of the penitent Believer's Soul, be not at firſt a confirmed habit of Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; yet it is ſuch as at that <hi>preſent</hi> time, doth <hi>in a good meaſure purge out ſin,</hi> and for the <hi>time to come</hi> makes it well nigh impoſſible for ſin ever to <hi>recover</hi> its power in, and over the Soul again.</p>
               <p>This Book of <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> is acknowledged by all learned Men to be genuine and uncorrupted, and, ſo far as we know, he was never yet taxed with errour by any Man, for aſſerting (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Here it is obſervable, that <hi>Juſtin,</hi> Chriſt's bleſſed Martyr, Fifteen Hundred Years agoe, poſitively denies, that God pardons Sinners <hi>before they repent;</hi> and declares, that they <hi>deceive themſelves,</hi> that they are deſperate, or <hi>witleſs</hi> Creatures, quite <hi>out of their right mind,</hi> who perſwade themſelves, that if they know God, he will pardon their ſins, <hi>before they repent,</hi> mourn for, and turn from their ſins</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the Third Century, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Book of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Chap. 4. writes thus, <hi>Omnibus delictis,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>The ſame God, who by his righteous Judgment hath ordained puniſhment for all ſins that are committed, either in the Fleſh or Spirit, either in the outward Deed, or inward Will and Deſire, hath alſo promiſed</hi> pardon by Repentance, <hi>ſaying to the People,</hi> Repent, and I will ſave thee. <hi>And again,</hi> As I live, ſaith the Lord, I had rather Repentance, <hi>then Death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repentance is</hi> Life, <hi>(that is, it is the way and means to Life,) ſince it is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, or more deſired than death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a little after, <hi>Poenitentia quae per Dei gratiam oſtenſa &amp; indicta nobis, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam nos Domino revocat: Repentance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which by the grace of God is revealed to us, and commanded,</hi> brings us into Favour again <hi>with the Lord,</hi> that is, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93177:48"/>is a <hi>means</hi> and condition of God's own appointing upon the uſe and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, we are received again into favour with the Lord.</p>
               <p>And after the middle of the ſame Book, <hi>deſertam dilectionem Epheſiis imputat, &amp;c. The Lord imputes unto the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>that they had left their firſt Love, he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them of</hi> Thyatira <hi>with Fornication, and eating of things ſacrificed to Idols; He accuſes them of</hi> Sardis, <hi>that their works were not perfect before God; he reproves them of</hi> Pergamus <hi>for teaching perverſe Doctrine; he rebukes the</hi> Laodiceans <hi>for truſting that they were rich and needed nothing: And yet he admoniſhes them all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with threatnings indeed; but he would not threaten to puniſh the impenitent, if he were not willing to pardon the penitent; (and ſaith, if any doubt of this, for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſuch doubts) illum etiam mitiſſimum patrem non tacebo, qui prodigum filium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, &amp;c. I will not forbear to mention that moſt meek Father</hi> (in the <hi>parable) who calls back his Prodigal Son, and after his poverty and diſtreſs,</hi> gladly receives him upon his Repentance, <hi>kills the fatted Calf, adorns his Joy with a Feaſt, and why not? For he had found his Son, whom he had loſt, and he had felt his love to be the greater towards him, becauſe he had regained him. Now whom muſt we underſtand by this Father? Why even God; for none is ſo much a Father as he, none ſo affectionate as he. Thorefore he ſhall receive thee his Son, although thou haſt prodigally ſpent, that which thou hadſt received from him, although thou returneſt naked, yet he will receive thee, becauſe thou art returned:</hi> And <hi>he will rejoyce more in thy return, than in another mans ſobriety:</hi> Sed ſi <hi>poeniteat ex animo,</hi> but it is on condition that thou repent <hi>from thy heart, that thou compare thy hunger-ſtarved condition with the plenty of thy Fathers hired Servants; that thou forſake the ſwine, thoſe unclean beaſts,</hi> that thou come back to thy Father, <hi>though he be offended with thee, ſaying, Father, I have ſinned, nor am I worthy to be now called thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we plainly ſee, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> preached the neceſſity of ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance antecedently to the obtaining pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Tertullian</hi> we alledge bleſſed <hi>Cyprian</hi> for a Witneſs of the ſame Truth. Thus then he writes, <hi>Dominus loquitur, &amp;c. Operum Cypr. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 18. <hi>edit. Colon. Agrip. An.</hi> 1617.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſpeaketh and ſaith, to whom ſhall I look, but to him that is humble and ſtill, and trembleth at my words: Seeing we ought to be all ſuch, they then much more ought to be ſuch whoſe Duty it is to endeavour that after a grievous fall</hi> they may obtain God's favour and mercy by true Repentance <hi>and great humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his 52 Epiſtle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> page 59. Dominus in Evangelio, &amp;c. <hi>The Lord in the Goſpel ſetting forth the goodneſs and kind affection of God the Father, ſaith, What man is there of you, who if his Son ask of him bread, will give him a ſtone? Or if he ask a fiſh will give him a Serpent? If ye then who are evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask him? The Lord here makes a compariſon between a Carnal Father, or a Father of the Fleſh, and the Eternal and large goodneſs and kindneſs of God the Father: Now if it be ſo that this evil ſinful Father upon Earth, who hath been grievouſly offended by his ſinful and wicked Son, yet if afterwards he ſee</hi> him reformed, and having forſaken the ſins of his former Life, and being by the ſorrow of Repentance amended and changed to ſober and good manners, <hi>and to the Diſcipline of Innocency</hi> (or to a Holy courſe of Life,) <hi>he both rejoyceth and is glad, and having received him whom he formerly had caſt off, he embraces him with the deſire of a Fatherly Joy: How much-more doth that One and True Father, who is Good, Merciful, and Kind, yea Goodneſs, Mercy, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, rejoyce in the Repentance of his Children, neither doth he threaten wrath to the penitent, nor puniſhment to them that mourn and lament; But he rather</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth them pardon and favour? <hi>Whence the Lord in the Goſpel, ſaith,</hi> They are bleſſed who mourn, <hi>for he that mourns moves compaſſion; Whereas he that is ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and proud, heaps up to himſelf the wrath and puniſhment of the judgment to come.</hi>

               <p>And in his eighth Epiſtle to the Clergy and People, after he had told them that according as it had been revealed and foretold by prophecy, the Enemy had got power over them, and had raiſed a terrible Perſecution againſt them, becauſe of their Diviſions and Contentions, their breaking the Lords Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſleepy way of Prayer; and after he had moſt paſſionately exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to give themſelves much to Watching and prayer, to earneſt, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, fervent Prayer Night and Day, and had preſſed them thereunto both by precept and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who ſpent Days and Nights in Prayer, and had likewiſe encouraged them thereunto by telling them that Chriſt prayed not for himſelf and his own ſins, but for them and for their ſins, he added as it is in <hi>pag.</hi> 16. of that Book. <hi>Quod ſi pro nobis, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. <hi>which if it be ſo, that he (the Lord Jeſus) labours, and watches, and prays for us and for the pardon of our ſins, how much the more ſhould we continue in Prayer and Supplication? We have Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and God, to be Advocate and Interceſſour for our Sins,</hi> if ſo be, (or on condition) that we repent of our ſins paſt, <hi>and confeſſing and being ſenſible of our Faults, whereby we now at this preſent time offend the Lord, we promiſe that for time to come we will walk in his ways, and fear his Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this that we have cited, and by much more that we could cite out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it may evidently appear that that bleſſed Martyr of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was far from being of Opinion that God pardons the ſins of his People <hi>before they repent.</hi> Indeed to tell People that God pardons their ſins <hi>before they repent,</hi> it is <hi>falſa miſericordia,</hi> falſe or deceitful Mercy, it is not <hi>(curare, ſed ſi dicere verum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus,</hi> occidere,) the way to cure but (if we will ſpeak the Truth) to <hi>kill Souls,</hi> in the Judgment of thoſe Ancient Elders and Deacons, who wrote the 31. <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Cyprian, page</hi> 37. and <hi>Cyprians</hi> himſelf was of the ſame.

                  <hi>He who flatters a ſinner with ſweet and pleaſant words, gives him occaſionto ſin, and doth not reſtrain but nouriſh: his ſinful luſts. Whereas he who at once both reproves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whom I love</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I rebuke and chaſten. So the Miniſter of God ought not to deceive the People by cunning and couſening compliances, but to provide ſound and ſaving Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for their Souls. He an ignorant, unskilful Chirurgion who is afraid to feel with his hand the ſwelling is hollowneſs of wounds, and whilſt he keeps the corrupt humour cloſe ſhut up in the ſecret receſſes of the bowels, he increaſes it, and makes the wound more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The wound muſt be opened, and inciſions muſt be made, and the Malady muſt be cured with a ſtronger, and ſharper Remedy, even by cutting off, and taking away the fleſh that is corrupted and putrified. Let the ſick Perſon cry out and complain as he will, by reaſon of the pain which he hath not patience to endure, yet afterwards he will thank the Chirurgion, when he finds that he is cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and ſure this is ſufficient to ſhew that he would never have ſaid that it is bad counſel to tell an awakened Sinner that he muſt repent of his known ſins, mourn for them, leave and loath them. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was more loving and faithful to the Souls of Men than ſo to betray them to the Enemy of their Salvation; he would have loſt his Life before he would have done it. And indeed he did at laſt loſe his Life for his faithfulneſs to Chriſt, and to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93177:49"/>Souls of his People. He <hi>laid down his life for the brethren,</hi> he ſealed the Truth of Chriſt's Goſpel with his Blood, about the Year of our Lord 250, and that is above fourteen hundred years ago. Theſe five Fathers flouriſhed within the firſt Three Hundred years after Chriſt, when the Church was in its greateſt purity, and Three of them, to wit, <hi>Clement, Juſtin,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> were <hi>Martyrs;</hi> we need ſay no more to vindicate our Doctrine from the aſperſion of Novelty, which is fulſty caſt upon it, yet we think fit to add further two or three Teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers who afterwards were great Aſſerters of the neceſſity and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God's Grace againſt the <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Our Saviour himſelf with the commanding power of his own voice ſpeaks unto the will of man, ſaying, repent and believe the Goſpel; yet it is clear a man receives from God Repentance unto Life, that he may begin to believe in God; ſo that he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God at all, unleſs he, receive Repentance by the gift of God who ſheweth Mercy. But what is a Mans Repentance, but the change of his Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Thereſore God who gives a Man Repentance, doth himſelf change Mans Will,</hi> Now obſerve here,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That in the Judgment of the foreſaid Fifteen Fathers, the Lord both Commands and gives Repentance unto Life.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the Lord gives Repentance <hi>before</hi> we believe in God, becauſe he gives us Repentance that we may begin to believe in God.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That we cannot believe in God, at all, unleſs God firſt give us Repentance; which muſt be underſtood in this ſenſe, that we cannot believe at all with the Faith of <hi>fiducial conſent and recumbency</hi> unleſs it be firſt given us to repent, for it is ſelf-evident that we can and do believe with the Faith of <hi>aſſent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do repent, and indeed we neither do, nor can repent till we firſt believe with the Faith of aſſent; as was ſhewed before; And it is clear from their own words that they meant not, that we cannot believe with the Faith of aſſent, but that we cannot believe with the Faith of conſent and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducial recumbency, unleſs it be firſt given us to repent. Their words are, <hi>A Man receives from God Repentance unto Life,</hi> (ut in Deum credere incipiat) <hi>that he may begin to believe in God.</hi> Now by believing in God undoubtedly, they meant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, ſo as to <hi>conſent</hi> to have him for our God, and ſo as to <hi>truſt</hi> him as our God: And could not mean only believing ſo far as to <hi>aſſent</hi> that there is a God, and that his word is true: For they were the Diſciples of Holy <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and had learned of him to diſtinguiſh between <hi>(credere Deum, credere Deo, &amp; credere in Deum) believing a God,</hi> and <hi>believing that all God ſaith is true;</hi> and <hi>believing in God,</hi> ſo as to love him and take him for our God, and truſt him as our God. It is this <hi>believing in God</hi> which they ſay cannot be begun till we have firſt repented through Grace, and this is a great Truth, as we ſhewed before out of <hi>Calvin:</hi> And ſince this believing with fiducial conſent and recumbency is juſtifying Faith, it follows evidently that thoſe Fifteen Fathers held Repentance to be <hi>before</hi> Remiſſion of Sins, and before Juſtification, as it conſiſts in Remiſſion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93177:50"/>of Sins; becauſe they held it to be before Juſtifying Faith, whereby we receive Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) We obſerve they ſay that <hi>Repentance</hi> is <hi>a change of our Will,</hi> and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by giving us Repentance, changes our Wills. Therefore in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Fifteen Fathers there is and muſt be <hi>a real change</hi> in us, <hi>before we be juſtified</hi> and pardoned. And we muſt let our Authour know that theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are for us againſt him, were burning and ſhining Lights in their day. Moſt of them (if not all) ſuffered baniſhment for the true Faith of Chriſt, under the perſecution of the <hi>Arian Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> For we have a Synodical Epiſtle of theirs concerning <hi>the Grace of God, and the will of man</hi> which was written by them in their Exile in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> to which, Twelve of their Names are prefixed, the ſelf-ſame names which are prefixed to the foreſaid confeſſion of Faith concerning the <hi>Incarnation and Grace of our Lord Jeſus</hi> directed to <hi>Petrus Diaconus</hi> and his Brethren who were come from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, to receive information concerning the Faith of the <hi>Weſtorn</hi> Churches. We will here cite one ſhort paſſage out of the Synodical <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of thoſe Twelve baniſhed Paſtors of Chriſt's Church. It is in the 10th. <hi>Chapter. Quod autem vos dicitis, &amp;c. As to what ye (who wrote to us) ſay that man is ſaved by the alone Mercy of God; but they ſay unleſs a man run and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with his own will, he cannot be ſaved, We anſwer that both are fitly held, if the right order be kept between the Mercy of God, and will of man; that Mercy go before, and the Will follow; that God's Mercy alone confer the beginning of Salvation; with which afterwards the Will of Man may cooperate towards its own Salvation; that God's Mercy preventing or going before, may direct the courſe of mans will, and that mans will obeying, through the ſame Mercy or Grace following it, may accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its intention run towards the (heavenly) prize.</hi> Here we ſee that it was the Judgment of thoſe Twelve Confeſſors, That we are ſaved by the alone Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace of God, if through Grace preventing and aſſiſting us, we yield <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Lord, and run and labour to obtain the prize of Eternal Life and Glory. And that if we do not this, we cannot be ſaved. This is what we ſay that ſincere Obedience is ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary that without it we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved. It ſhall ſuffice at preſent to have demonſtrated by the Teſtimonies aforeſaid that we are no Innovators, no Preachers of a <hi>new Goſpel,</hi> and Divinity in this matter, ſince we have Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Fathers of the beſt and pureſt Ages on our ſide, all giving in teſtimony for us, and againſt our Authour. It will not conſiſt with our deſigned brevity to alledge more teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Doctors of the Primitive Church, and therefore we paſs from them to the <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> the Doctors and Paſtors of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>We begin with the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, and the Edition we make uſe of, is that which was printed at <hi>Wittenbergh</hi> in the year 1540. In the 20th.
<note place="margin">Teſtimonies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines.</note> Article concerning Faith, theſe are its words. <hi>Primum igitur de fide &amp; juſtificatione ſic docent, Chriſtus apte complexus eſt ſummam Evangelii, &amp;c. First therefore they</hi> (the Proteſtant Miniſters and Churches) <hi>thus teach concerning Faith and Juſtification; Chriſt hath fitly comprehended the Sum of the Goſpel, when in the laſt Chapter of</hi> Luke <hi>he commands Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins to be preached in his Name. For the Goſpel reproves ſin, and requires Repentance, and at the ſame time offers Remiſſion of ſins freely for Chriſt's ſake, and not for our own worthineſs. And as the preaching of Repentance is univerſal, ſo alſo the promiſe of Grace is univerſal, and commands all to believe and receive the benefit of Chriſt, as Chriſt ſays, Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden. And</hi> Paul <hi>ſays, He is rich unto all that call upon him. Therefore though ſome Contrition</hi> and Repentance is neceſſary, <hi>yet we muſt believe that Remiſſion of ſins is given unto us, and that of unjuſt we are made juſt, that is, reconciled or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93177:50"/>accepted, and made the Children of God, freely for Chriſt's ſake, and not for the worth or merit of contrition, or of other works that go before, or follow after: But this benefit is to be received by faith, &amp;c.— Therefore when we ſay that we are juſtified by Faith, we do not underſtand this, that we are juſt for</hi> the Dignity, Worth, or Merit of the Vertue of Faith it ſelf. <hi>But this is the meaning,</hi> that <hi>we obtain the remiſſion of ſins and the imputation of Righteouſneſs</hi> through Mercy for Chriſt's ſake; but this Mercy cannot be received but by Faith; <hi>And here Faith ſignifies not merely the knowledge of the Hiſtory, but it ſignifies to believe the promiſe of Mercy, which we obtain for Chriſt the Mediator: — For what can be more acceptable to an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, trembling conſcience, in its true ſorrows and pains, than to hear, that this is the Command of God, this is the voice of Chriſt the Bridegroom, that they be ſurely perſwaded that Remiſſion of ſins, or Reconciliation is given not for our worthineſs, but freely through Mercy for Chriſt's ſake, that the benefit may be certain. As for the word Juſtification in thoſe paſſages of</hi> Paul, <hi>it ſignifies the Remiſſion of ſins, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, or imputation of Righteouſneſs, that is, the acceptation of the Perſon.</hi> And in the ſame Article, the paragraph concerning good works. [<hi>This new life then, ſhould be obedience towards God. And the Goſpel preaches Repentance, nor can there be Faith, but in thoſe who repent, becauſe Faith comforts Mens hearts in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fears of ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover <hi>we alſo teach concerning this Obedience, that they who commit mortal ſins,</hi> (that is, <hi>wilful preſumptuous ſins againſt Knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,) are not juſt, becauſe God requires this obedience, that we reſiſt our corrupt luſts and affections. But thoſe who do not reſiſt, but obey them againſt the Command of God, and do actions againſt their Conſcience, they are unjuſt, and they neither retain the Holy Spirit nor Faith, that is, confidence of Mercy. For in thoſe who delight in ſin, and</hi> do not repent, there cannot indeed be that Truſt or Confidence, <hi>which may ſeek for remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This paſſage of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion we thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that habitual reigning, wilful ſin againſt Conſcience, and without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is inconſiſtent with a ſtate of Grace, and Reconciliation. And we think that all Proteſtants (except <hi>Antinomians</hi>) are agreed in this. One paſſage more, and we have done with this Confeſſion of Faith. It is in the ſame 20th. Article <hi>of Faith,</hi> a little before the paſſage laſt quoted. <hi>There is no need here of diſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about predeſtination, and the like. For the promiſe is univerſal, and it takes nothing from works, yea it ſtirs up to Faith and to Works that are truely good. For remiſſion of ſins is transferred or removed from our Works (unto God's) Mercy, not that we may do nothing, but much rather, that we may know how our Obedience pleaſeth God, in our ſo great infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the firſt Proteſtant Confeſſion of Faith, written by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Proteſtant Churches, ſubſcribed by their Miniſters, and that not onely by <hi>Luther,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, but even by <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubſcribed by ſeven Princes and Dukes in <hi>Germany,</hi> and by the Magiſtrates of Cities, and preſented unto the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. in the Year 1530. We hope then, it will not be denyed, but that this <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion contains the true Doctrine of the Goſpel in the points of Juſtification by Faith, and of the neceſſity of Repentance unto the obtaining pardon of ſin; and of ſincere Obedience unto the obtaining of Eternal Salvation. And if ſo, then our Doctrine in thoſe points, is likewiſe the true Doctrine of the Goſpel, for it is the ſame with that of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, as to thoſe Matters of which we treat.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, and the Teſtimony of many Princes, Paſtours, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Churches, who ſubſcribed, and received it, we come to the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which we have all ſubſcribed, the 11th. Article concerning Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication we moſt heartily embrace, and acknowledge that it is a moſt wholſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and full of comfort, that we are juſtified by Faith onely, in that ſenſe which is more largely explained in the Homily of Juſtification, to which the Article ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly refers us, and which by conſequence we have ſubſcribed, by ſubſcribing the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93177:51"/>Article. It is called a <hi>Sermon of the Salvation of Mankind by Chriſt onely;</hi> and a very good Sermon it is, worth a thouſand of our Authour's Letter, which deſerves not to be mentioned the ſame Day with it. For underſtanding then the true and full meaning of the Article of Juſtification, we muſt have recourſe to the Homily, or Sermon of Salvation. In which Excellent Sermon, pag. 13. We read as followeth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>London Edit.</hi> 1673.</note> 
                  <hi>[That though according to the Apoſtle, we are juſtified by a true and lively Faith onely, and that that Faith is the Giſt of God. [Yet that Faith doth not ſhut out Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread, and the Fear of God, to be joined with Faith in every Man that is Juſtified, but it ſhutteth them out from the office of Juſtifying.</hi> So that <hi>although they be all preſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> (marke that, they do not onely neceſſarily follow, and flow from Faith in time, but when we are firſt Juſtified, they are preſent together with it,) <hi>in him that is Juſtified, yet they Juſtifie not altogether, nor the Faith alſo doth not ſhut out the Juſtice of our good Works, as neceſſary to be done afterwards, of Duty towards God (for we are moſt bounden to ſerve God, in doing good Deeds commanded by him, in his Holy Scripture, all the Days of our life,) but it excludeth them, ſo that we may not do them to this intent, to be made good by doing them. For all the good works that we can do, be imperfect, and therefore not able to deſerve our Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. — Again in the ſecond part of that Sermon, pag. 15. <hi>Nevertheleſs this Sentence, that we be Juſtified by Faith onely, is not ſo meant of them, that the ſaid Juſtifying Faith is alone in Man, without true Repentance, Hope, Charity, Dread and Fear of God at any time and ſeaſon. Nor when they ſay, that we be Juſtified freely, they mean not, that we ſhould, or might afterwards be idle, and that nothing ſhould be required on our parts afterwards: Neither they mean not, ſo to be juſtified without good Works, that we ſhould do no good Works at all. — But this ſaying, that we be juſtified by Faith onely, freely, and without Works, is ſpoken for to take away clearly all Merit of our Works, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deſerve our Juſtification at God's Hand, and thereby moſt plainly to expreſs the weakneſs of Man, and the Goodneſs of God, the great infirmity of our ſelves, and the Might and Power of God, the imperfectneſs of our own works, and the moſt abundant Grace of our Saviour Chriſt, and therefore wholly to aſcribe the Merit and Deſerving of our Juſtification unto Chriſt onely, and his moſt precious Blood-ſhedding. This Faith the Holy Scripture teacheth us, this is the ſtrong Rock and Foundation of Chriſtian Religion, this Doctrine all Old and Antient Authours of Chriſt's Church do approve, this Doctrine advanceth, and ſetteth forth the true Glory of Chriſt, and beateth down the vain-glory of Man, this whoſoever denieth is not be accounted for a Chriſtian Man, nor for a ſetter forth of Chriſt's Glory, but for an Adverſary to Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and for a ſetter forth of Mens vain-glory.</hi> Again, pag. 16. <hi>The true meaning, and underſtanding of this Doctrine, we be Juſtified freely by Faith without Works, or we be Juſtified by Faith in Chriſt onely, is not, that this our own Act to believe in Chriſt, or this our Faith in Chriſt, which is within us, doth juſtify us, and deſerve our Juſtification unto us, (for that were to count our ſelves to be juſtified by ſome Act or Vertue, that is within our ſelves,) but the true underſtanding and meaning thereof is that, although we hear God's Word, and believe it, although we have Faith, Hope, Charity, Repentance, Dread and Fear of God within us, and do never ſo many Works thereunto: Yet we muſt renounce the Merit of all our ſaid Vertues, of Faith, Hope, Charity, and all other Vertues and good Deeds, which we either have done, ſhall do, or can do, as things that be far too weak and inſufficient, and imperfect, to deſerve remiſſion of our ſins, and our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore we muſt truſt onely in God's Mercy, and that Sacrifice which our High Prieſt and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, once offered for us upon the Croſs, to obtain thereby God's Grace, and Remiſſion, as well of our Original Sin in Baptiſm, as of all Actual Sin committed by us after our Baptiſm, if we truly repent, and turn unfeignedly to him again.</hi> And at the end of the ſame 16. and beginning of 17. Page, <hi>You ſee, that the very true meaning of this Propoſition, or Saying, we be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in Chriſt onely (according to the meaning of the Old, Antient Authours, I)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93177:51"/>is this: We put our Faith in Chriſt, that we be juſtified by him only, that we be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by God's free Mercy, and the Merits of our Saviour Chriſt onely, and by no Vertue or good Works of our own, that is in us, or that we can be able to have, or to do, for to deſerve the ſame: Chriſt himſelf only being the Cauſe meritorious thereof.</hi>] All this, we moſt heartily approve of: But we doubt, whether our Authour will join with us in it, becauſe he ſays, the Papiſts own this, <hi>That Chriſt onely is the Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification.</hi> And if it be ſo,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lett. pag.</hi> 6.</note> then according to his reckoning the Church of <hi>England</hi> and we, may be both Papiſts, in the point of Juſtification, notwithſtanding that the ſaid Homily was written purpoſely againſt the Papiſts, and we have all ſubſcribed to it. It may be our Authour has ſo accuſtomed himſelf to call Men <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when ever he is angry with them, that he cannot forbear it; and therefore as he uſed to call the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men Papiſts, ſo now being angry with us, his Paſſion may have excited him to bring his Habit into Act, and to rank us alſo among Papiſts, in the point of Juſtification. But we leave this, and proceed to what is more material; and that is, that if we be not Juſtified by Works, becauſe they do not, nor cannot merit Juſtification, then it will follow that for the ſame reaſon, we are not Juſtified by Faith, becauſe Faith can no more merit Juſtification, than Works. This Objection the Authour, or Authours, of the Homily foreſaw, and anſwered it, by confeſſing that Faith doth not Juſtify us on the account of its meritorious Nature, but on another account. Their Words are theſe, [<hi>As great and as godly a Vertue, as the lively Faith is, yet it putteth us from it ſelf, and remitteth or appointeth us unto Chriſt, for to have only by him remiſſion of our ſins or Juſtification. So that our Faith in Chriſt (as it were) ſaith unto us thus, It is not I that take away your ſins, but it is Chriſt only, and to him only I ſend you for that purpoſe, forſaking therein all your good vertues, Words, Thoughts and Works, and only putting your truſt in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Third Part, Pag. 17. <hi>Nevertheleſs, becauſe Faith doth directly ſend us to Chriſt for remiſſion of our ſins, and that by Faith given us of God, we embrace the Promiſe of God's Mercy, and of the remiſſion of our ſins, (which thing none other of our vertues or works properly doth,) therefore Scripture uſeth to ſay, that Faith without Works doth Juſtify.</hi>] Thus far that Excellent Sermon. And this is the ſame thing which we maintain, That God hath choſen Faith above all other Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to be the receptive, applicative Condition, or moral Inſtrument and Means of Juſtification, becauſe it hath a proper and peculiar aptitude and fitneſs for that uſe, being both of an illuminative and receptive Nature; and as it is of an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Nature, it aſſures us, that we can be Juſtified by no Satisfaction and Merit, but that of Chriſt, and ſo it ſends us to him alone for Juſtification: Then as it is of a receptive Nature, it embraceth the Promiſe, and takes hold of him, and his Righteouſneſs, as held forth to us in the Promiſe, that thereby, and for the Satisfaction and Merits thereof alone, and for no other thing, we may be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. In this ſenſe we hold, that we are Juſtified by Faith onely, and that Faith is the onely receptive, applicative Condition of Juſtification. Yet this hinders not, but that Repentance is the diſpoſitive Condition of Juſtification. The Homily ſaith expreſly, that Faith doth not ſhut out Repentance, but that they are preſent together, <hi>and that by Faith we truſt only in Gods mercy, and Chriſts Sacrifice, to obtain thereby Remiſſion of all Sins, Original and Actual, if we truly repent, and turn unfeignedly to him again,</hi> Part 2. pag. 16. Which words manifeſtly ſhew, that they held Repentance to be a Condition of Juſtification; but it cannot be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Authours of the Homily, either a meritorious Condition, for there is none ſuch at all poſſible; nor a receptive, applicative Condition, for that is the office of Faith onely. Therefore it muſt be a diſpoſitive Condition. And then after one is Juſtified, it is evident, that they held ſincere Obedience to be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93177:52"/>neceſſary to his continuing in a Juſtified ſtate, and obtaining Eternal Salvation. For they ſay in Part 3. pag. 17. <hi>that if after we are Juſtified, and made Members of Chriſt, we care not how we live, whether we do good, or avoid evil Works, we make our ſelves Members of the Devil,</hi> and ſurely that is inconſiſtent with a Juſtified ſtate: Therefore to prevent our becoming Members of the Devil again, ſincere Obedience from a Principle of Faith and Love is indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. And that this was their true meaning is further evident from the Sermon of Good Works, Part I. pag. 29. Where they quote and approve the ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> concerning the penitent Thief. The words are, <hi>[This I will ſurely affirm, that Faith onely ſaved him. If he had lived, and not regarded Faith, and the works thereof, he ſhould have loſt his Salvation again.]</hi> Indeed this is but a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and we have no reaſon to think, that if he had lived longer he would not have been careful to lead a Life of Faith and Holy Obedience; yet if the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be ſuppoſed, the conſequent neceſſarily follows, that he would have loſt his Salvation again. For as it is in the Sermon of Faith, [<hi>To them that have evil works,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Second Part p.</hi> 24.</note> and lead their Life in diſobedience, and tranſgreſſion, or breaking of God's Commandements, without Repentance, pertaineth not everlaſting Life, but everlaſting Death, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, they that do evil ſhall go into everlaſting fire,</hi> Mat. 25.] Theſe Paſſages do manifeſtly ſhow, that in the Judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is indiſpenſably neceſſary to obtain forgiveneſs of ſin, ſo ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, from a principle of Faith and Love, and bringing forth Fruits meet for Repentance, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to the eſcaping of eternal damnation, and obtaining of eternal Salvation. Let any Man read, and conſider the Sermon of Repentance in the ſame Book, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 324. and he will ſee this to be as clear as the Light at Noon-day. We will quote one ſhort Paſſage out of it, in Page 339. they ſay, <hi>[The filihineſs of ſin is ſuch, that as long as we do abide in it, God cannot but deteſt and abhorre us, neither can there be any hope, that we ſhall enter into the Heavenly Jeruſalem, except we be firſt made clean, and purged from it. But this will never be, unleſs forſaking our former Life, we do with our whole Heart return unto the Lord our God, and with a full purpoſe of Amendment of Life, flee unto his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, taking ſure hold thereupon, through Faith in the Blood of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.]</hi> This excellent Paſſage ſhews clearly, that as Faith is the receptive, applicative Condition, ſo true Repentance is the diſpoſitive Condition of the Covenant of Pardon and Life, and that the one is as neceſſary in its kind, as the other is; and that unleſs through Grace we do both, we are undone for ever. Thus we have ſhewed at large what was the old Goſpel Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the Reformation, and that our Doctrine is exactly the ſame. Therefore it muſt needs be a moſt horrid (we will not ſay lye, but) falſehood, that we preach a new Goſpel, and that we are to be blamed for telling People that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and mourn for their known ſins, leave and loath them, and God will have Mercy upon them for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>From whole Societies of Proteſtants, we paſs to the Teſtimonies of Individual Paſtours of the Reformed Churches. And we begin with <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Commentary on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. ſayes, <hi>(Deus ergo non ita vult omnes ſalvos fieri, ut diſcrimen omne tollat boni &amp; mali; ſed praecedit veniam poenitentia, quemadmodum hîc dicitur:) Therefore God doth not ſo will all Men to be ſaved, as to take away all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between good and evil; but Repentance goes before Pardon, as it is here ſaid.</hi> And again on the ſame Text, <hi>We hold therefore, that God doth not will now the death of a Sinner, becauſe he calls all to Repentance, without making a difference, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he ſhall be ready to receive them (modo ſeriò reſipiſcant) if they (or on condition that they) earneſtly repent.</hi> And in his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he writes thus,

               </p>
               <p>In theſe paſſages we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays expreſly, That Repentance is a Condition annexed to the promiſe of pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That the performance of that Condition goes before pardon; And,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That therefore we are to repent, and ſo perform the Condition, that we may obtain the Grace of pardon.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment Repentance is a Condition of Juſtification, and that becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> believed Juſtification and pardon of ſin to be the ſame thing, as is moſt evident from what he writes againſt <hi>Oſiander, Inſtit.</hi> 3d. <hi>Book, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.11, 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) That in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment Repentance is the diſpoſitive Condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. For it muſt be either the receptive or diſpoſitive Condition; but it cannot be the receptive Condition, for in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgment Faith is the only receptive Condition, therefore it muſt be the diſpoſitive Condition. And indeed <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo held it to be, for in his third Book of Inſtitutions, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. He ſays, <hi>Privatim Deo confiteri, pars eſt verae poenitentiae quae omitti non poteſt. Nihil enim minus conſentaneum quam ut peccata ignoſcat Deus, in quibus nobis ipſi blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, &amp;c. To confeſs our ſins in ſecret to God, is a part of true Repentance, which cannot be omitted: For nothing is leſs becoming or ſuitable, than that God ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us thoſe ſins, in which we flatter or pleaſe our ſelves.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Calvin</hi> writing againſt <hi>Pighius,</hi> ſays,

For thus he writes in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Quoties ergo audimus, <hi>&amp;c. Therefore as often as we hear,

(Ne ergo ipſi adoptionis jure nos abdicemus, hàc ſemper enitendunt, quo tendit noſtra vocatio:) Therefore leaſt we ſhould abdicate, diſinherit; or deprive our ſelves
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93177:53"/>of the right of Adoption, we muſt evermore be endeavouring to attain the end of our (Chriſtian and Heavenly) calling.</hi> By this paſſage we ſee that <hi>Calvin</hi> held ſincere filial Obedience to be a Condition neceſſary on our part to our continuing in a ſtate of Sonſhip, and to our obtaining the Heavenly Inheritance of Children. It is confeſſed, that he did not think, that the performance of ſuch Obedience, and perſeverance therein to the end, depends principally on Man's Will; nor do we think any ſuch thing, nay we declare, that it depends principally on God's ſpecial Grace and Favour through Jeſus Chriſt. He alſo did not think the ſaid Obedience to be meritorious; nor do we, nay we utterly abhor any ſuch Thought: So that in this Matter <hi>Calvin</hi> and we do exactly agree againſt our Authour:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſt.</hi> l. 3. c. 14. Sect. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayes, <hi>(Dum operum fiduciam excludimus, hoc volumus duntaxat, ne mens Chriſtiana ad operum meritum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut ad ſalutis ſubſidium, reflectatur: Sed penitùs reſideat in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitâ juſtitiae promiſſione:) Whilſt we exclude all truſt or confidence in works, we mean this onely, that the mind of a Chriſtian ſhould not look on the merit of good works, as unto an help towards the obtaining Salvation, but that it ſhould wholly reſt in the free Promiſe of Righteouſneſs.)</hi> Here <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf gives us a Key to open the true meaning of any Expreſſions of his, that may incline any body to think, that he ſlighted good Works of holy Obedience. And he would have us to know, that all ſuch Perſons, that think ſo of him, quite miſtake his ſenſe, for his true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only, that good Works are not in the leaſt meritorious, that under that falſe notion they are to be ſlighted indeed; and that true Chriſtians ſhould have no regard unto them, as if by their merit they could help us to obtain Salvation. now under this falſe Notion we reject them utterly, as much as our Authour or any other Man can do. Yet can we never allow that good Works which are really ſuch ſhould be cryed down as unneceſſary to Salvation in that way that the Lord hath made them neceſſary; much leſs can we agree to the horrid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Amsdorſian Lutherans,</hi> that good Works are pernicious to Salvation. So much for <hi>Calvin.</hi> Next to him it is fit that <hi>Beza</hi> ſhould appear to give in his Teſtimony. And he gives it clearly on our ſide. For thus he writes in his 20th. Epiſtle, <hi>Conjunctas autem eſſe poenitentiam, &amp; remiſſionem peccatorum, &amp;c. That Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins are joyned together; and ſo indeed that Repentance goes before Remiſſion of ſins, partly the expreſs Word of God teaches it, partly alſo Reaſon it ſelf and common ſenſe, how corrupt ſoever, ſhews it.</hi> John (<hi>ſays</hi> Mark <hi>in his</hi> 1. <hi>Chapter</hi>) <hi>preached the Baptiſme of Repentance for Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And Luke 13. <hi>Except (ſays Chriſt) ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> And Luke 24.47. <hi>Repentance</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Luke) <hi>and Remiſſion of ſins muſt be preached in his Name. Moreover nothing doth occur more frequently in the Scriptures than ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies: For neither doth the Lord vouchſafe the Grace and Favour of Remiſſion of ſins unto others but them that are penitent.</hi> From this paſſage we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That it is a Truth ſo bright and clear, that Repentance goes before pardon of ſin, that in <hi>Beza</hi>'s Judgment the common Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind doth or may diſcern it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That this Teſtimony can not be eluded and put off, by ſaying that it is a legal and not an Evangelical Repentance that goes before pardon of ſin. For the proofs which <hi>Beza</hi> brings from Scripture, will by no means admit of this Evaſion. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Repentance that (<hi>Beza</hi> ſaith) goes before pardon of ſin, is the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which Chriſt exhorted the <hi>Jews</hi> unto, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. and which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Apoſtles to preach unto all Nations in his Name, beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47.</note> But certainly that was an Evangelical, and not a meer legal Repentance.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93177:53"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Repentance which in <hi>Beza</hi>'s Judgment goes before pardon of ſin, is a Repentance to which is made the promiſe of pardon of ſin, ſo that whoſoever doth not thus repent ſhall periſh, but whoſoever doth thus repent ſhall not periſh. Therefore it is and muſt be an Evangelical, and cannot be a meer Legal Repentance, for pardon of ſin is not promiſed to a meer Legal Repentance: And it cannot be truly ſaid, that a Man who repents with a meer legal Repentance ſhall not periſh. Thouſands have periſhed Everlaſtingly, who yet repented with a meer legal Repentance: And <hi>Judas</hi> was one who ſo repented, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3, 4. And when he had done it, he went and hanged himſelf. It is moſt evident then that <hi>Beza</hi> did not bring thoſe Texts to prove that a meer legal Repentance goes before pardon of ſin, for thoſe Texts do not ſpeak of a meer legal Repentance, but of one that is truely Evangelical, to which pardon of ſin is ſo infallibly aſſured, That whoſoever doth not ſo repent, ſhall periſh, and whoſoever doth ſo repent, ſhall not periſh.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, yet <hi>Beza</hi> affirms in the ſame Epiſtle, that contrition of Heart doth not properly proceed from the Goſpel. We Anſwer, It is true, he doth ſay ſo, but it is plain, he was miſtaken in that, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſayes expreſly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſt.</hi> l. 3. c. 3. Sect. 19.</note> that (<hi>Cum totam Evangelii ſummam breviter complecti voluit, dixit,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>When the Lord Chriſt would comprehend the whole ſumm of the Goſpel in few words, he ſaid that it behoved him to ſuffer, to riſe again from the dead, and that Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins muſt be preached in his Name, and this the Apoſtles after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection preached, that he was raiſed up by God to give Repentance unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Remiſſion of ſins.</hi>) It may be, <hi>Beza</hi> had ſome peculiar conceit, that all Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of what kind ſoever, is properly from the Law, and but improperly from the Goſpel. It would ſeem ſo by his ſaying, that a contrite Heart is not properly from the Goſpel; and yet a contrite Heart is the Sacrifice which God will not deſpiſe, which he is certainly well-pleaſed with through Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. But though <hi>Beza</hi> was miſtaken in ſaying, that a contrite Heart is not properly from the Goſpel, yet he plainly ſaw the main Truth which we plead for, and confeſſed it, and proved it by clear Scripture, that ſincere Repentance goes before pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Beza,</hi> in his Confeſſion of Faith, Cap. 4. Art. 5. ſayes, <hi>Pater Caeleſtis nobis annunciat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Heavenly Father declares to us, that he hath ſo loved the World, that he hath given his only begotten Son for it,</hi> ea conditione, <hi>on that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> And Art. 6. he ſayes, <hi>that Faith embraces, and appropriates to ones ſelf, Chriſt and all that is in him; for ſince be is offered us to be poſſeſſed by us, with this condition, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; one of the two th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, muſt neceſſarily be, to wit, either that all is not in Chriſt, which is neceſſary to our Salvation: Or if all be in him, then he poſſeſſeth all things, who poſſeſſeth Chriſt by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his ſhort Confeſſion, Art. 10. <hi>Itaque meritò concludere poſſumus, in uno Jeſu Chriſto contra omnia mala quae conſcièntias noſtras terrere poſſunt — prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiſſima remedia reperiri: Sed addenda eſt conditio, ſi iſta remedia nobis applicemus. Therefore we may juſtly conclude, that in one Jeſus Chriſt there are found ſoveraign, infallible remedies againſt all the evils that can terrifie our Conſciences: But this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be added, if we apply thoſe remedies to our ſelves.</hi> We ſee <hi>Beza</hi> put it into his Confeſſion of Faith, as an Article of his Belief, that the Goſpel Covenant hath a Condition, and is conditional.</p>
               <p>The ſame Authour in his little Book of Queſtions and Anſwers, the Firſt Part, to the Queſtion, You ſay then that Good Works are neceſſary to Salvation? he Anſwers, <hi>that if Faith be neceſſary to Salvation, then Good Works are likewiſe neceſſary to it, (non tamen ut ſalatis cauſam,) yet not as the cauſe of Salvation, (for we are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93177:54"/>juſtified, and therefore live onely by Faith in Chriſt,) but as ſomething that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily joined with Faith, as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, they are the Children of God, who are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14. <hi>And</hi> John, <hi>that he is righteous who doth righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 John 4.7. — <hi>So that it plainly appears they are contentious Men, who condemn the neceſſity of Good Works, as a falſe Doctrine.</hi> Thus <hi>Beza.</hi> And we do no more ſay, that Good Works are neceſſary, as the cauſe of Salvation, than he doth; nor do we, any more than he, ſay that Good Works without Faith are the neceſſary Condition of obtaining Salvation. On the contrary we ſay, that Faith is the Spring of all our good Motions, and runs through them all, and that it is Good Works done from a Principle of Faith and Love, which are the neceſſary Condition of obtaining Salvation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To the Queſtion, What then if Faith be firſt given to a Man at the point of Death? For this ſeems to have been the caſe of the penitent Thief, who was crucified (with Chriſt.) What good Works can ſuch a Man do? <hi>Beza</hi> Anſwers, <hi>Yea the Faith of that Thief in a moſt ſhort time, was unſpeakably energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or effectual and operative, for he reproved the other Thief for his blaſphemies and wickedneſs, he abhorred his own Crimes; with a firm and moſt wonderful Faith, he acknowledged Chriſt to be an Eternal King, and prayed unto him as a Saviour, under the very ignominy and ſhame of the Croſs, when all his own Diſciples were ſilent, and ſpoke not one word for him; he did alſo openly rebuke the</hi> Jews <hi>for their Cruelty and impious Expreſſions. But ſo it is that Confeſſion of ſin, Prayer to God the Father through Chriſt, and thanksgiving, are the moſt excellent Works of the Firſt Table, which in no Man can be wholly ſeparated from Faith. And although ſome may be ſo prevented by Death, as not to have power to ſhew forth any works of the Second Table; yet in ſuch a Man Faith is not therefore to be eſteemed idle and unfruitful, becauſe it hath Love conjoined, though not in Energie and Act, yet in Power and Principle.</hi>] Thus far <hi>Beza.</hi> To which we agree, as we ſaid before, In ſuch extraordinary caſes, God requires no more of Men, as abſolutely neceſſary to their Salvation, than they have time and ſtrength to perform; but accepts the will for the deed through Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
               <p>Our next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> the Authour of the Book of Martyrs. The World hath been told already, in the defence of Goſpel-Truth, pag. 35. that holy Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Latine Book, of Chriſt freely Juſtifying, maintains <hi>that Faith is the proper, receptive, applicative Condition of Juſtification, and that Repentance is the diſpoſitive Condition, it is that which prepares us for receiving Juſtification.</hi> But ſome who read that Diſcourſe of his in the Book of Martyrs, which our Authour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them unto, may poſſibly object, that in the ſecond Volume of the Book of Martyrs, pag. 192. he ſaith, <hi>The Promiſe of Life and Salvation is offered unto us freely without any Condition.</hi> We Anſwer, It is true, he doth ſay ſo, but he means, that it is without any <hi>Meritorious, Legal</hi> Condition, and all ſuch Conditions we reject as much as he did, or any Man can do, as appears by what we have ſaid at large, in giving account of our Judgment concerning the Conditionality of the Covenant. That this was Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s true meaning, appears from his own Words in the ſame Page, a few Lines after, [<hi>The Voice of the Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>differeth from the Voice of the Law in this, that it hath no Condition adjoined of our meriting, but only reſpecteth the Merits of Chriſt the Son of God.</hi>] If our Authour will not admit of this explication of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Words, that he only rejected all Meritorious and Legal Conditions; but will needs have it, that he abſolutely rejects all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Covenant of Grace, both Legal and Evangelical; then we muſt ſay, that he hath little reſpect to the Memory and Credit of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> ſince he makes him moſt ſhamefully to contradict himſelf: And was he fit then to write a Book of Martyrs, or to be himſelf a Witneſs for the Truth againſt the Papiſts! Can he be juſtly admitted to bear witneſs againſt others, who by ſelf-contradiction
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93177:54"/>is a falſe Witneſs againſt himſelf. Truly we ſhould be loath ſo to expoſe that good Man to the ſcorn of the Papiſts; and therefore we poſitively affirm, that he doth not contradict himſelf at all, becauſe the Conditions are of different kinds which he denies and affirms. He denies that there are any properly, meritorious, legal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the new Covenant; and ſo do we: He affirms, that there is a proper Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Condition, to wit Faith and conſtant Confeſſion: (They are his own Words in his Latine Book aforeſaid.) And we join with him in affirming the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now we do further make it known to the People, that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in the ſaid Book concerning Chriſt freely Juſtifying, doth grant, that after we are freely juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, ſincere Obedience to Chriſt's Commandments is neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or not to loſe our Juſtification. Theſe are his own Words, [<hi>Quod autem dici ſolet per obedientiam retineri juſtificationis gratiam,
<note place="margin">Page 369, 370.</note> ut hoc concedatur aliquo modo, non tamen hinc,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As for that which uſeth to be ſaid, that the Grace of Juſtification is retained by Obedience; though that be granted in ſome ſenſe, yet it doth not follow from hence that Juſtification is by Obedience. Moreover when we ſay, that Juſtification is retained by Works, that is not ſo to be taken, as if it were done for the dignity or merit of our Actions, but onely for the Redeemer's ſake; for whoſe ſake the Perſon is firſt accepted, and then the Actions alſo pleaſe God, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of themſelves would be impure, and of no account. But ſay they, the perſeverance or continuance of Juſtification is loſt by wicked works. But we ſay, evil works are two ways to be conſidered in us; either as they cleave to us, or remain in us, as in all the Saints through infirmity of the fleſh, and we by and by riſe again, by Repentance and Faith; and ſuch ſin, as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſhall not have dominion over us. Or again, they may be conſidered, as againſt our Conſcience we willingly give up our ſelves to ſin, that we may ſerve it with evil delight: But this ſort of ſin can no wiſe conſiſt with this Faith of which</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks, which hath place in none, but in thoſe who being turned from ſin, are converted unto God.</hi> — And in the ſame Book, pag. 374. <hi>Love is neceſſary, and it pleaſeth God, to wit, in thoſe who are reconciled, and for the ſake of Chriſt. For God naturally rejoiceth in the Obedience of thoſe that are his; which though it be imperfect, yet endeavours ſuch as they are, he approves in thoſe whom he hath reconciled to himſelf in Chriſt. So then Faith, that is, Chriſt apprehended by Faith, juſtifies us freely. But we again ought by no means to receive that Grace in vain: But he receives it in vain, whoſoever he be, that doth not yeild himſelf obedient to the Commands and Example of Chriſt.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> where we ſee he plainly grants, that ſincere Obedience after we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is neceſſary that we may not loſe the Grace of Juſtification; and this is no more, but that it is neceſſary to prevent our falling wilfully under the guilt of new ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, which without renewing our Faith and Repentance, and returning to God, and our Obedience to him again, would certainly damn us, and ſink us into Hell. We mean no more by it, and we believe, that God for Chriſt's ſake will keep all his juſtified ones from ſo falling away, but withal we hold, that God keeps us in a juſtified ſtate, partly by fear of falling into ſin, and partly by the Faith of the indiſpenſable neceſſity of Obedience and Repentance, as means to be uſed on our part to keep us from falling away. The Lord puts his fear in our Hearts, that we may not depart from him; and he keeps us by his power through Faith unto Salvation.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Fox</hi> we paſs to <hi>Rollock,</hi> another good Man, unto whom a Famous and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Epiſcopal Divine, Dr. <hi>Robert Baron,</hi> hath given this Teſtimony, that he was (<hi>Sanctiſſimus &amp; Doctiſſimus,</hi> &amp;c.) a moſt Holy and Learned Man, and that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> might be truly attributed to him, that he was very Meek above all the Men which were upon the Face of the Earth. This Meek Saint wrote a Book of Effectual Calling at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in the Year 1597. juſt about an Hundred Years agoe. In which he affirms poſitively, that the Covenant of Grace is conditional, and that both Faith and Repentance go before Juſtification.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93177:55"/>
               <p>In the Firſt Page of his Book, he ſays, <hi>Vocati, eâdem Dei gratiâ reſpondent, credunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in Deum per Jeſunt Chriſtum. Reſponſio haec ſides eſt, quae reipſâ eſt conditio promiſſionis,</hi>

This Anſwer is the Act of Faith, which is the very Condition of the Promiſe that is in the Covenant of Grace. Wherefore Effectual Calling conſiſts in the Promiſe of the Covenant, which is made on Condition of Faith, and in Faith, (quae nihil aliud eſt, quàm impletio conditionis,) which is no other thing, but the fulfilling of the Condition.</hi> And in the 24th Chapter, pap. 258. he ſayes, (<hi>Reſipiſcontia Juſtificationem antecedit,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Repentance goes before Juſtification, after the manner that Faith and Hope go before it: For it is ſaid of the</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>that he preached the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Mark 1.4. <hi>and</hi> Luke 3.3. And if any would know, what he means by that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which, he ſayes, goes before Juſtification; after he had fully and clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the nature of it in all its parts, and ſhewed it to be an Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and diſtinguiſhed it from that which is called Legal; he tells us in Page 257. what he meant, by giving a ſhort, but comprehenſive definition of it, thus, <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipiſcentia eſt poſt functum &amp; malum jam perpetratum, dolor propter offenſum Dèum, &amp; ex dolwe mutatio quaedam totius animi à malo in bonum:) Repentance is a grief or ſorrow (after the fact is done, and the ſin is committed,) for having thereby offended God, and a change of the whole Soul from Evil to Good, ariſing from that grief or ſorrow.</hi> This is the Repentance which <hi>Rollock</hi> ſayes, goes before Juſtification; and it is remarkable, that he makes a change of the whole Soul, from Evil to Good, to be eſſential unto this Repentance, and conſequently, that in order of nature before Juſtification, there is a real change of the whole Soul from Evil to Good. This Doctrine was preached, and written at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> an Hundred Years agoe, and then it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good Divinity, and <hi>old Goſpel,</hi> and the Preacher of it was eſteemed, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, a great Saint, and a Man of Learning and Judgment, both at home and abroad. How it ſhould come to be <hi>New Divinity,</hi> and a <hi>New Goſpel,</hi> or part of a new Goſpel now, is to us a Myſtery, for ſure it is an Hundred Years older now, than it was then. Any Body therefore might think, in all reaſon, that our Authour came too late to give it a new Name. There muſt be ſome Myſtery in this buſineſs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; We with it be not a Myſtery of Iniquity.</p>

But what if after all this, <hi>Zanchy</hi> be clearly for us in this matter, then it is to be hoped that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor our Authour himſelf, will not eaſily believe, that we not only neglect, but deſpiſe our good Friend. And that he is ſuch, we are content that his own Words ſhould judge between us, <hi>Credimus ad veram juſtitiae Chriſti par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipationem,

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93177:55"/>to thoſe who would have their Juſtification and pardon, and likewiſe their ſin and the World altogether.

We wiſh our Authour do not himſelf deſpiſe <hi>Zanchy</hi> for their ſake, ſince in thoſe few words, he hath comprehended the whole Summ of the new Goſpel (ſo called,) which is a good deal above Sixteen Hundred years old. <hi>Zanchy</hi> in the ſame place ſays, <hi>Tria ſunt Evangelii capita, quae a nobis exiguntur ut praeſtemus, poenitentia in deum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There are three heads, or principal parts of the Goſpel, which we are required to do, Repentance towards God, Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſtudious care to obſerve whatſoever Christ hath commanded.</hi> And again, <hi>The Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>requires only theſe three things, That being touched with a ſerious grief for all the ſins of our whole Life, we deſire from the heart that our mind and all our affections may be changed and renewed by God unto an obedient complyance with his Divine Will. And that this may be done, that we ask it of God by Prayer, and uſe our own endeavours in order to the effecting of it.

Faith is indeed the Condition of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in reſpect of the inviolable order inſtituted by God, but it is alſo a promiſed gift of the new Covenant, and an effect of our ingrafting into Chriſt.</hi> In theſe words (1.) We obſerve, That in the Judgment of thoſe Divines approved by the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> God by his abſolute Will hath inſtituted a conditional order between the antecedent and ſubſequent bleſſings of the new Covenant. (2.) That Faith is the Condition ordained by God for obtaining the ſubſequent bleſſings of the Covenant, ſuch as Juſtification, Pardon of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) That it is not habitual Faith, or the firſt habitual, ſeminal perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent principle of Faith, but it is actual Faith, becauſe they ſay that it is the effect of our ingrafting into Chriſt; but the firſt ſeminal permanent principle of Faith is not the effect of our ingrafting into Chriſt, otherwiſe we ſhould be ingrafted into Chriſt before we have ſo much as the leaſt ſeminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith, ſince the cauſe muſt be before the effect. Therefore to avoid that abſurdity, we think they meant that our ingrafting into Chriſt begins in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits working in us the ſeminal principle of Faith, which concurs to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Act of Faith, which being our formal vital Act, though produced by the Vertue of the Seminal Principle, and the effectual influence of the Spirit, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant performed by us, and withal, is the effect of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itial ingrafting into Chriſt. The ſame Doctrine is believed and profeſſed at <hi>Geneva</hi> at this day, Witneſs what was lately Taught and Publiſhed by <hi>Turretin</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity there.</p>

Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Edit.</hi> Genev. 1688.</note> as the Duties and Conditions of the Covenant.</hi> And in the ſame Page he ſaith, that <hi>The form of Words wherein the new Covenant is expreſſed (I will? be your God, and you ſhall be my People) comprehends both the Benefits promiſed on God's part, and the Duties required on our part. And firſt he explains at large what promiſed Benefits on God's part are implied.</hi> in the Words (I will be your God.) Secondly, he ſhews what Duties required on our parts are implied in the Words (you ſhall be my People.) After he had in general opened the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the foreſaid Form of the Covenant; he comes to particulars, and in the 29. Paragraph he ſayes, <hi>The Principal Duties required of us are Faith and Repentance: Faith, which embraces the Promiſes, and Repentance, which fulfils the Commandments: Faith anſwers to the Promiſe of Grace, believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved; Repentance is commanded</hi> (Lege Evangelicâ) <hi>by the Evangelical Law, walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> Gon. 17.1. <hi>For as on God's part, there are two principal Benefits of the Covenant, Remiſſion of ſins, and the writing of the Law in the Heart; ſo on Man's part, two Duties ought to anſwer unto them, to wit, Faith which applies unto us the Remiſſion of ſins; and Repentance, or the ſtudy and endeavour of Sanctification, which reduces into practice the Law written in the Heart, by walking in God's Statutes; which Chriſt meant when he ſaid,</hi> Mark 1.25. <hi>Repent, and believe the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Page 202. he puts the Queſtion, Whether the Covenant of Grace be condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and what are the Conditions of it? And in Anſwer to it, he diſtinguiſhes between ſeveral ſorts of Conditions, and as we have done, ſhews that in ſome ſenſe it is not Conditional; and then he concludes, that in another ſenſe it it Conditional; and Page 203. he proves it by three Arguments: (1.) <hi>Becauſe it is propoſed with a Condition expreſſed,</hi> John 3.16, 36. Bom. 10.9. Acts 8.37. Mark 16.16. <hi>And frequently in other places.</hi> (2.) <hi>Becauſe if it were not conditional, there would be no place for Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Goſpel, which cannot be denounced, but againſt thoſe who neglect to performe the Condition preſcribed: For the neglect of Faith and Obedience cannot be culpable, if they be not required.</hi> (3.) <hi>Becauſe otherwiſe it would follow, that in this Covenant God is bound to Man, but Man is not bound to God, which is moſt abſurd, and contrary to the nature of all Covenants, wherein there is a mutual Agreement, and reciprocal Obligation, whereby the Parties Covenanting are bound to one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in Page 204. he comes to Anſwer the Second Branch of the Queſtion, to wit, Which are the Conditions of the New Covenant? And ſaies, that as for Faith, there is no queſtion but it is the Condition of the Covenant, becauſe the Scripture ſo clearly affirms it ſo to be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. and 10.9. And he ſayes, that Faith is the Condition of the Covenant, as it hath reſpect unto, and is the Inſtrumental Means of our Union with Chriſt. Yea he maintains (as we do) that in this ſenſe Faith is the onely Condition, becauſe there is no other Condition, that is of a receptive, applicative Nature, as Faith is; no other, that receives Chriſt, and applyes his Righteouſneſs, as Faith doth. But in another ſenſe, there are other Conditions of the Covenant beſides Faith, that is, if the Word <hi>Conditions</hi> be taken for all thoſe things which a Man by the Covenant of Grace is bound to do, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders, but Repentance and new Obedience may be called a Condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are comprehended among the Duties of the Covenant, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Moreover he holds, that though new Obedience be not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary antecedent, yet it is the ſecondary ſubſequent Condition of the Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being by Faith the primary Condition actually brought into Covenant, now Obedience is <hi>[medium &amp; via per quam tendimus ad plenam poſſeſſionem bonorum foederis.]</hi> the means and way by which we come to the full poſſeſſion of the good things of the Covenant. He ſaith, we ſhould diſtinguiſh between the Condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Condition of the Covenant, the Promiſe of Juſtification is not the whole of the Covenant, and therefore that which is the Condition of the Promiſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93177:58"/>Juſtification, is not the whole Condition of the Covenant, which adequately conſidered, is of larger extent than the Promiſe of Juſtification. He tells us laſtly, that we ſhould diſtinguiſh between the firſt accepting of the Covenant, and the after-keeping of the Covenant. Faith accepts the Covenant by receiving the Promiſes; Obedience keeps the Covenant by fulfilling the Commands. Be ye holy, for I am holy. And yet this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not Legal, but Evangelical, becauſe it is not meritorious, it is the Fruit and Effect of an antecedent Principle of Spiritual Life wrought in us, and of the actual Influence of the Spirit of Grace upon us; and it is not rigorouſly exacted in the higheſt degree of Perfection, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation; but though it be imperfect, yet it is admitted and accepted through Chriſt, if it be ſincere.</p>
               <p>We have here given a true and faithful account of the Judgment of the Learned and Judicious <hi>Turretin,</hi> concerning the Conditionality of the Covenant of Grace, with whom we agree in this matter, which contains the ſum of the Goſpel, as to Man's Duty eſpecially; and therefore, if <hi>Turretin</hi> was no Legal Preacher, no more are <hi>we,</hi> and if <hi>he</hi> preached <hi>no new Goſpel,</hi> no more do <hi>we;</hi> for we preach the ſame Goſpel, and in the ſame manner, as he did. There is one thing more wherein this worthy Divine and we do perfectly agree, and that is concerning true Believers fallen into wilful ſin againſt Knowledge and Conſcience. We ſay they cannot be ſaved till they have firſt recovered themſelves, through Grace, by renewing their Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and returning to their Obedience again. Now he ſayes the ſame thing, witneſs what he writes in the ſame Book, Pag. 671, 672. where he ſayes, <hi>That if a Believer fallen into groſs ſin againſt his Conſcience, be conſidered in himſelf, and as guilty of ſuch ſin not repented of, (verum eſt reum eſſe mortis, &amp; ſi in eo ſtatu moreretur certo damnandum,) it is true, that he is guilty of death, and if he dyed in that ſtate, he would be certainly damned; but if he be conſidered with reſpect to God's Decree of Election, he is rightly ſaid to be one, who is to be abſolved, or pardoned and ſaved; God ſo ordering the matter, by his immenſe Love and Wiſdome, that he never dies in that ſtate, but by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Act of Faith and Repentance, he is firſt reſtored, and returns into the way, before he come to the end. Whence it is, that according to a twofold reſpect, theſe two Propoſitions, although they ſeem to be contrary, may be both together true. It is impoſſible that</hi> David, <hi>a Perſon elected, and a Man according to God's own Heart, ſhould periſh: It is impoſſible that</hi> David, <hi>an Adulterer and Murderer, if Death ſeize on him before he have repented, ſhould be ſaved. The firſt of theſe Propoſitions is true, in reſpect of God's Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſecond is true alſo, in reſpect of the hainouſneſs and demerit of</hi> David<hi>'s ſin. But God's Providence and Grace looſeth this Knot, by taking care, that neither</hi> David, <hi>nor any of the Elect, dye in that ſtate, in which for his impenitence, he ſhould be excluded from Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Paſſage ſhews, that <hi>Turretin</hi> believed, as we do, that after Juſtification ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience is ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, that unleſs a Believer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the practice of ſincere Obedience, or if there happen to be any ſignal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtion by groſs wilful ſin for a time, unleſs he renew his Faith and Repentance, and thereby return to his Obedience, he cannot be ſaved. And <hi>Turretin</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in Page 669. ſaies very judiciouſly, <hi>That though God hath promiſed perſeverance to Believers, yet hath he not promiſed it to be given abſolutely, and without means, but by means to be uſed by Man himſelf, ſo that whilſt God keeps Man, he is bound alſo to keep himſelf by the Grace of the Spirit,</hi> 1 John 5.18. <hi>Whence Believers are ſure of their perſeverance through the Faith of the Promiſes, not by any external force, which retains them in the way of Salvation, will they, will they, yea even whilſt they are living in their ſins, but in the uſe of Means, and practice of Piety, whilſt working out their own Salvation with fear and trembling, they are confident that it is God who works in them, both to will and to do, and who graciouſly perfects the good Work which he hath begun. So that an occaſion of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and impiety is wrongfully inferred from this Doctrine, ſince to indulge wickedneſs, and to have the Grace, which cauſeth perſeverance, are utterly inconſiſtent. Yea, he that hath this Hope purifieth himſelf,</hi> 1 John 3.3. <hi>And he ought to be certainly perſwaded in himſelf,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93177:58"/>that without holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God, and that there is no other way to Life, but the way of Piety and Godlineſs.</hi> A moſt Excellent Paſſage this is, which fully expreſſes our ſenſe, and to which we heartily ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this is that which we find in Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Examination of <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> Chap. 13. Pag. 594. That a Promiſe, that we ſhall perſevere in Faith, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eternal Salvation, though we walk after the Fleſh, and lead a wicked life, may be called a <hi>diſſolute Promiſe,</hi> but that we do not maintain an abſolute Promiſe of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>in that diſſolute ſenſe;</hi> for though the Promiſe of perſeverance in Faith be <hi>abſolute;</hi> yet it is always joined with an <hi>abſolute Promiſe of perſeverance in Holineſs and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> and as it is neceſſary to Salvation, that Elect Believers continue in Faith, ſo <hi>it is neceſſary that they continue in Holineſs and Obedience.</hi> And if for ſome time there happen to be an intermiſſion of Faith and Obedience, there muſt be a renewing of them again, that we may obtain Salvation, and this renovation of our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the effect of the abſolute Promiſe; but not the obtaining of Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and before the renewing of our Faith and Repentance, and returning to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This is plainly <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s ſenſe. And indeed he goes further than we have done, in that he aſcribes <hi>an inferiour kind of Cauſality to Obedience and good Works in order to the obtaining of Eternal Salvation; for which he quotes</hi> Calvin, Bucer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Examen Armin.</hi> cap. 12.</note> Zanchy, <hi>and</hi> Voetius, <hi>yea he quotes the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>ſaying, that our light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> In the Pages 531, 532, 533. of that Book. Again, he ſays expreſly, <hi>That the hope of Eternal Life (ex eo vana eſſe colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, ſi non innitatur ſincerae obedientiae tanquam fulcro ſecundario,</hi> 1 Johan. 3.3.) <hi>is hence proved to be vain and groundleſs, if it be not upheld by ſincere obedience, as a ſecondary ſlay or prop.</hi> Pag. 592. of the ſame Book. And in another Book he ſaith, <hi>that it is a new Hereſy of Antinomians to deny a Conditional Goſpel; it is all one,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Survey of Antin.</hi> Part II. p. 63.</note> as to belye the Holy Ghoſt, who ſaith, He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not is condemned already. Spanhemius</hi> likewiſe, a very Learned Divine, and zealous againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> in his Diſputation at <hi>Leyden,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the five controverted Articles, ſaith in the 34th. Theſis or Poſition, <hi>(Omnibus equidem externè vocatis annunciatur promiſſio Evangelii, non tamen abſolutè ſed conditionatè, ſi reſipiſcant &amp; credant.) The Promiſe of the Goſpel is indeed preached to all that are outwardly called, yet not abſolutely, but conditionally, if they believe and repent.</hi> And Theſ. 36. <hi>For as it is in vain, that a great Good is ready at hand to us, unleſs we either take and receive, or fulfil the Condition which is required in the Covenant and Promiſe of it; ſo that infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Redemption, is in vain purchaſed for us by Chriſt, except we embrace it with a ſure confidence, and performe Faith and Repentance unto God requiring them as the terms of the Covenant,</hi> John 3.16. Acts 2.38. And to draw towards a cloſe, with the Teſtimonies of ſome of our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, we find that Dr. <hi>Robert Abbot</hi> writing againſt <hi>Thompſon,</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Abbot. <hi>contra</hi> Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoni <hi>Diatrib. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſ. Juſtif.</hi> p. 212.</note> (<hi>Credi non debet remiſſio peccatorum ante poenitentiam, &amp; poenitere aliquem de peccato non poteſt, quod non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>It ought not to be believed, that Remiſſion of ſins is before Repentance; and a Man cannot repent of a ſin, that is not yet committed,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>Remiſſion of ſins is never decreed for any (of ripe years) without Repentance, nor is it ever granted upon another Condition,</hi> (that is, another diſpoſitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;) <hi>the Faith therefore of Remiſſion ſhould not anticipate Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither let us think, that without Repentance we ought ever to ſay, Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And becauſe our Authour ſaith, that God hath bleſſed <hi>England</hi> with an <hi>Ames</hi> and <hi>Twiſs</hi> againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 13. p. 27.</note> and that we neglect and deſpiſe them; we will alledge ſome Teſtimonies out of their Writings, by which the World may judge, whether thoſe two great Divines be for him, or for us, in this cauſe. And firſt for Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>Grevinchovius,</hi> page 138. he ſayes, <hi>(Quòd fides haec non ſit volitionis ipſius divinae conditio, ſed ſalutis aſſequendae tantùm, hanc ego ſententiam meam eſſe fateor, veramque cum Deo praeſtiturum me confido.) That this faith of ours, is not the condition of Gods will it ſelf, but that it is only, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93177:59"/>of our obtaining Salvation; I confeſs this to be my opinion, and I truſt, with Gods help, that I ſhall prove it to be true.</hi> We obſerve here, that <hi>Ames</hi> diſtinguiſheth between <hi>Gods will of our Salvation,</hi> and <hi>our Salvation it ſelf,</hi> which is the object of his will. As for the firſt, to wit God's Will, Faith is not, cannot be the Condition of God's Will, becauſe it is Eternal and Abſolute, and cannot poſſibly depend upon any Condition whatſoever; But the ſecond, to wit our Salvation, the object of God's Will, it may have, and <hi>hath a Condition;</hi> and God hath abſolutely willed, that it ſhould have, and depend upon a <hi>Condition,</hi> and that Faith ſhould be the Condition on which our obtaining of it doth depend. This is his meaning, and we agree with him in it.</p>
               <p>The ſame Authour in another Book, his Marrow of Divinity, ſaith, <hi>That the Promiſes of the Goſpel are without any diſcrimination propoſed unto all, together with a Command to believe;
<note place="margin">Medul. Theologiae, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>pag.</hi> 112.</note> but they are not performed unto all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men themſelves fail in performing the Condition: But unto the Elect the Condition is given, that the Promiſes may be performed to them.</hi> Which he proves by three Scriptures (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. and <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 18.) whereof one proves <hi>Faith,</hi> and the other two prove <hi>Repentance</hi> to be the Gift of God. Whence it is moſt evident that he thought <hi>Repentance</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> to be <hi>the condition</hi> of the Goſpel-Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſame Book, and next Chapter, he ſays, <hi>This Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is for Chriſt conſidered not abſolutely,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 27. <hi>pag.</hi> 118.</note> in which ſenſe Chriſt is alſo the cauſe of effectual vocation, but for Chriſt apprehended by faith, which faith follows effectual calling as its effect, and goes before Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as the Inſtrumental Cauſe apprehending that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, upon which Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſo apprehended, Juſtification follows.</hi> In this Paſſage we highly approve the order in which he placeth things, as putting <hi>effectual calling</hi> in order of nature <hi>before faith,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> before <hi>Juſtification:</hi> But where he ſaith, that Faith is the <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for which we are Juſtified, ſome poſſibly may think, that he aſcribes <hi>too much</hi> unto Faith, yet we think, that the <hi>difference</hi> between him and thoſe who do not love to ſay, that <hi>Faith</hi> is an <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> is more <hi>verbal</hi> than <hi>real;</hi> for he doth not ſay, that Faith is the Inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification, (that indeed had been to aſcribe too much unto Faith;) but the Inſtrumental cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, upon which follows Juſtification; now we all acknowledge Faith to be of an apprehenſive, receptive nature, and that it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental means whereby we apprehend and receive Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, that we may be Juſtified; and our uſing that Inſtrumental means, as the Lord hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the <hi>receptive condition</hi> to which the Promiſe of <hi>Juſtification</hi> is made. Here then ſeems to be a meer <hi>difference in words,</hi> when we mean the ſame thing. Laſtly, for <hi>ſincere Obedience,</hi> he holds it to be, in ſome ſenſe, a <hi>cauſe</hi> of obtaining Eternal Life; which is more than we have aſcribed to it, in calling it a <hi>Condition,</hi> for a Condition as ſuch hath no <hi>cauſal Influence.</hi>

                     <hi>Ibid. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 199.</note> His own Words in the ſaid Book are theſe, <hi>Our Obedience indeed is not the principal, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of Eternal Life. For we receive the right of this life, and the life alſo it ſelf from the Grace and Gift of God, for the ſake of Chriſt apprehended by faith:</hi> Rom 6.23. <hi>The gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. But yet it is a</hi> cauſe <hi>ſome way adminiſtring, helping and moving forward towards the poſſeſſion of this life, whereof we had the right before; for which reaſon it is called the way, in which we walk to Heaven,</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>And it promotes our life, both of its own nature; becauſe it is ſome degree of life it ſelf, ſtill tending to perfection; and alſo by vertue of God's Promiſe, who hath promiſed Eternal Life to thoſe who walk in his Commandments:</hi> Gal. 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting. For though all our Obedience, while we live here, is imperfect, and contaminated with ſome mixture of ſin:</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, yet through Chriſt it is ſo acceptable unto God, that it is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a moſt great reward. The Promiſes therefore made to the Obedience of the Faithful, are not Legal but Evangelical, although by ſome they are ſaid to be of a mixt nature.</hi> In all this, <hi>Ames</hi> aſcribes as much to ſincere Obedience, and makes it as neceſſary to Salvation,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93177:59"/>as we do. If we ſay it is a <hi>Condition,</hi> he ſayes it is in ſome ſort <hi>a Cauſe</hi> of obtaining the poffeſſion of Eternal Salvation: And ſure to be ſo <hi>a Cauſe,</hi> is as much at leaſt, as to be <hi>a Condition.</hi> Next let us ſee what Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> faith to theſe things: Indeed he is ſo clearly on our ſide, that if the Authour of the Letter had been acquainted with his Writings, he would have been wiſer than to have mentioned his Name in this Cauſe. For thus he writes, [<hi>We ſay that pardon of ſin and ſalvation of Souls are Benefits purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, to be enjoyed by Men, but how?

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 189.</note> according to the Rule of God's Word, I find to be of two ſorts: Some are of Benefits procured unto us by Chriſt, which are to be conferred on us</hi> conditionally; — <hi>they of this firſt ſort are Juſtification and Salvation; for</hi> Abraham <hi>received Circumciſion, as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith; Circumciſion therefore was an aſſurance of Juſtification to be had by Faith; if ſuch were Circumciſion to the</hi> Jews; <hi>we have good reaſon to conceive, that ſuch is Baptiſm unto us Chriſtians; for as that was unto them, ſo this is the Sacrament of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto us; And good reaſon, the Sacraments, which are Seals of the Covenant, ſhould aſſure that unto us, which the word of the Covenant doth make Promiſe of. Now, the word of the Covenant of Grace doth promiſe unto us both Remiſſion of ſin, and Salvation; upon Faith in Chriſt. This by our Doctrine we promiſe unto all, and aſſure unto all, as well as they do by theirs. If all, and every one ſhould believe, we nothing doubt, but they ſhould be juſtified and ſaved. On the other ſide, if not one of ripe years, ſhould believe, I preſume our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will confeſs, that not one of them ſhould be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Juſtification and Salvation is promiſed in the Word,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 190.</note> and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Sacraments, upon performance of a</hi> Condition <hi>on Mans part. Now the</hi> Condition <hi>of Juſtification and Salvation, we all acknowledge to be</hi> Faith. Thus Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> frequently in the foreſaid Book. And that this was his ſetled Judgment will appear by what he wrote afterwards in the Year 1634. in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hoards</hi> Book,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93177:60"/>called <hi>Gods Love to Mankind,</hi> which Anſwer was Printed after his Death by Mr. <hi>Jeanes,</hi> a very Learned and Zealous <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> in the Year 1653. at <hi>Oxford. The Miniſters of the New Teſtament,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Twiſs</hi> againſt <hi>Hoard,</hi> pag. 194, 195.</note> are called Miniſters not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; that is, not of the Law, the Miniſtry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is not the Miniſtry of the Spirit, but yet this is rightly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to wit, of the Spirit of Adoption; for undoubtedly even the Miniſtry of the Law, is the Miniſtry of the Spirit alſo, but of the Spirit of Bondage, to hold Men under fear: It is called the Miniſtry of Condemnation, and the Reaſon hereof I conceive to be, becauſe God doth not concur with the Miniſtry of the Law, by the Holy Spirit, to work any Man to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Condition of the Law, which is exact and perfect Obedience: But thus he doth concur with the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, namely, by his Spirit, to work Men to the performance of the</hi> Condition <hi>thereof, which is</hi> Faith <hi>in Chriſt and</hi> true Repentance, <hi>therefore the Letter, to wit, of the Law, is called a killing Letter; but the Goſpel is joined with a quickening Spirit, and therefore</hi> Piſcator <hi>conceives, that the Goſpel in this place is called by the Name of the Spirit. So then the Goſpel giveth Life by the Spirit, which accompanieth the Miniſtry thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame Book, he ſaith, [<hi>Some Benefits are beſtowed upon Man only</hi> conditionally <hi>(though for Chriſts ſake,) and they are the pardon of ſin, and ſalvation of the Soul,
<note place="margin">Page 154.</note> and theſe God doth confer only</hi> upon the Condition of Faith and Repentance. <hi>Now I am ready to profeſs, and that, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as out of the Mouth of all our Divines, that every one who hears the Goſpel (without diſtinction between Elect and Reprobate) is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, ſo far as to procure both the pardon of his ſins, and the Salvation of his Soul, in caſe he believe and repent. But there are other Benefits which Chriſt by his Obedience hath merited for us, namely, the Benefit of Faith and Repentance; for it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>And he hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt, that is, for Chriſts ſake,</hi> Eph. 1.3. <hi>And God works in us that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 13.21. <hi>And therefore ſeeing nothing is more pleaſing in Gods ſight on our part, then Faith and Repentance, even theſe alſo, I ſhould think, God works in us through Jeſus Chriſt: And the Apoſtle prays in the behalf of the</hi> Epheſians (Eph. 6.23.) <hi>for Peace, and Faith, and Love, from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is, us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Authour can ſay truely, that it is the conſtant Opinion of our Divines, that all who hear the Goſpel, whether Elect or Reprobate, are bound to believe, that Chriſt died to procure them Faith and Repentance.

This God himſelf ſignifieth to be his will by his Promiſe,</hi> Acts 2.38, 39. <hi>on the one part; and on both parts,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>And as God ſignifieth this to be his will, ſo indeed it is his will according to our Doctrine, and there is no colour of Impoſture or Simulation in all this. In like ſort, as touching the Grace of pardon of ſin, this alſo God offers unto all that hear the Goſpel, but how?</hi> not abſolutely <hi>but conditionally, in caſe they believe and Repent; and it is God's will, that every one who believeth, ſhall have his ſin pardoned; none that I know, either thinketh or teacheth otherwiſe, whether he falleth out, either to be Elect or Reprobate; though how to diſtinguiſh Men according unto this difference, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> that as many as believe and repent ſhall have their ſins pardoned, and their Souls ſaved:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93177:60"/>So if it can be proved, that there is no ſuch meaning in God, then in my poor Judgment it cannot be avoided; but that God muſt be found halting in his Offers. But for my part, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch a meaning in God, neither have I to this Hour, found any one of our Divines, either by Word or Writing, to have denyed this to be the meaning of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, [<hi>Whereas he</hi> (Hoard) <hi>faſhioneth our Doctrine, ſo as if we ſaid, that God hath decreed at no hand to ſave them, to whom he promiſeth Salvation upon Condition of Faith, this is a notorious untruth,
<note place="margin">

For to ſay, he hath reſolved at no hand to ſave them, is as much as to ſay, that he hath reſolved to ſave them on no Condition. But if he hath promiſed to ſave them in caſe they believe, undoubtedly he hath reſolved to ſave them upon Condition of Faith: Onely God's Reſolution to ſave them, is not held in ſuſpence, conſidering that from Everlaſting, he well knew who would believe, and who would not;</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>It is true, Baptiſm is ordained, that thoſe which do receive it, may have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſins, but not abſolutely, but conditionally, to wit, in caſe they Believe and Repent, as appears both in that place,</hi> Acts 2.38.
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>and Baptiſm as a Seal doth aſſure hereof, onely in caſe they Believe and Repent, and therefore none of Ripe Years were admitted unto Baptiſm, until they made Profeſſion of their Faith, and as for Infants, they were alſo antiently ſaid to be Baptized</hi> in Fide Parentum. By all theſe Paſſages, quoted Word for Word out of Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> it is as clear, as the Light at Noon-day, that <hi>he</hi> held <hi>the Covenant of Grace to be Conditional,</hi> and particularly, that the Promiſe of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and Pardon of Sin, is <hi>Conditional,</hi> and that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> not <hi>Faith</hi> alone, nor <hi>Repentance</hi> alone, but <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance together</hi> are the <hi>Condition</hi> of it. It is clear alſo, that he held, as we do, that God by his Special Grace purchaſed for us by Chriſt, and given to us for Chriſt's ſake, enables us, and all the Elect, to perform the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and that effectually and infallibly. As for the <hi>Non-Elect,</hi> who do not perform the <hi>Condition,</hi> he ſays the reaſon, the culpable reaſon of that is, becauſe <hi>they will not:</hi> and though it be true alſo that <hi>they cannot,</hi> yet that is not a meer Phyſical, but a <hi>moral cannot,</hi> which ariſeth from the evil diſpoſition of their minds and affections, whereby they <hi>will not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this was Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> his Judgment is evident by theſe following Teſtimonies of his quoted out of the ſame Book. <hi>Obſerve we farther how this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour confounds impotency moral,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 155, 156.</note> which conſiſteth in the corruption of mans powers natural, and impotency natural, which, conſiſteth in bereaving him of power natural. The Lord tells us by his Prophet</hi> Jeremiah, (<hi>cap.</hi> 13.23.) <hi>That like as a Blackamore cannot change his skin, nor a Leopard his ſpots, no more can they do good that are accuſtomed unto evil. Now if a man taken in ſtealth ſhall plead thus before a Judge; My Lord, I beſeech you have compaſſion upon me, for I have ſo long time inured my hands to pilfering, that now I cannot forbear it, will this be accepted as a good plea to ſave him from the Gallows.— As for Faith, It is well known that Divines diſtinguiſh between fides acquiſita, and ſides infuſa (acquired and infuſed Faith:) That we may call a Faith naturally acquired, which is found in carnal Perſons, whether Prophane or Hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ritical. And this (to wit the infuſed) is a Faith inſpired by God's Spirit. The object of each is all one, and a Man may ſuffer Martyrdom for the one as well as for the other, which manifeſſeth the pertinacious adherence thereunto: And it appears that all Profeſſions have had their Martyrs. Albeit it be not in the power of Nature to believe ſide infuſa, (with an inſpired Faith) yet it is in the power of nature to believe the Goſpel ſide acquiſitâ (with an acquired Faith) which depends partly upon a mans Education, and partly upon reaſon, conſidering the credibility of the Chriſtian way; by light of natural obſervations, above all other ways in the World. And when men refuſe to embrace the Goſpel, not ſo much becauſe of the incredibility of it, but becauſe it is not congruous to their natural affections, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells the Jews, light came into the World, and men loved darkneſs Father than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> John 3.19. <hi>Is there any reaſon why their condemnation ſhould be any whit the eaſier for this? Neither have I ever read or heard it taught by any, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As to the outward Reformation of their Life, though it be not in their power to regenerate their wills, and change their hearts, any more than it is to illuminate their minds: Yet I never read that any mans damnation was any whit the more encreaſed for not performing theſe acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The Man bereaved of his eyes hath a will to read, and conſequently it is no fault for not reading. For all ſin is in the Will. But it is not ſo, in not obeying either Law or Goſpel.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. page</hi> 170.</note> If a Man had a will to obey and believe, but he could not, in ſuch a caſe it were unreaſonable he ſhould be puniſhed. But in the caſe of diſobedience unto God, we ſpeak of, all the fault is in the will, voluntarily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, they neither will obey the one nor the other: Like as they that have accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do evil, cannot do good, as a</hi> Blackamoor <hi>cannot change his skin, yet with this difference, that man is never a whit the more excuſable, or leſs puniſhable, for not doing that which is good; not ſo the</hi> Blackamoor <hi>for not changing his skin.

               <p>Again, <hi>To the Rule of Law objected by Mr.</hi> Hoard, <hi>(That contractus ſub conditione imprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabili nullus aeſtimatur) a Contract or Promiſe made upon a condition not performable by the Party,
<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Doſt thou complain, thou haſt no power to believe, but I pray thee, tell me, haſt thou any will to believe? If thou neither haſt, nor ever hadſt any will to believe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 219, 220.</note> what a ſhameſul and unreaſonable thing is it, to complain that thou haſt no power to believe? St.</hi> Paul <hi>had a moſt gratious will, but he ſound in himſelf no power to do what he would, but what is the iſſue of this complaint? To ſly in the face of God? Nothing leſs! But to confeſs his own wretchedneſs, and flee unto God in this manner, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? And receiving a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Anſwer concerning this, concludes with thanks, I thank God through my Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If I have a will to believe, to repent, I have no cauſe to complain, but to run rather unto God with thanks for this, and pray him to give that power, which I find wanting in me. And indeed this impotency of believing and infidelity, the fruit of Natural Corruption common to all, is merely a moral impotency, and the very ground of it is the Corruption of the Will: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men cannot believe, cannot repent, cannot do any thing pleaſing unto God, becauſe they will not, they have no delight therein; but all their delight is Carnal, Senſual, and becauſe they are in the fleſh, they cannot pleaſe God; and becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, they cannot repent. Sin is unto them, as a ſweet Mirſel unto an Epicure, which he rolleth under his Tongue.</hi> This and much more to this purpoſe hath <hi>Twiſs</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Hoard.</hi> And that this was his ſetled Judgment is evident by what he writes in his defence of the Doctrine of the Synod of <hi>Dort.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>page</hi> 122, 123.</note> and it is as true that a carnal man hath no deſire that God would add the efficacy of his Spirit thereunto.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93177:61"/>to complain of their impotency to do that good which they would do, than the ſervants of God have, yea and holy</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf had. How can you believe (ſaith our Saviour, John</hi> 5.44.) <hi>Here is a certain impotency of believing, which our Saviour takes notice of; but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of impotency is it? Obſerve by that which followeth, (who receive Honour one of another, and regard not the Honour which cometh of God only.) Therefore you hear not my words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are not of God:</hi> John 8.47. <hi>This is as true, as the word of the Son of God is true, although this Authour ſets himſelf to impugne this kind of Doctrine all along. But withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, do they deplore this impotency? Doth the conſideration hereof humble them? Nay rather they delight in it, as the Prophet noteth,</hi> Jerem. 6.10. <hi>Their ears are uncircumciſed, and they cannot hearken; Behold the Word of God is as a Reproach unto them, they have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Teſtimonies of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> and more which might be quoted to this purpoſe, we plainly ſee that though he doth every where maintain that God by his ſpecial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating effectual Grace enables the Elect, (but not the <hi>non-Elect</hi>) to believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and obey the Goſpel, and ſo to performe the Condition of the Covenant; yet at the ſame time he declares that the inability of the Non-Elect to believe, repent, and obey, is <hi>a meer moral impotency,</hi> ariſing from the ill diſpoſition of their own minds and affections; that <hi>therefore they cannot, becauſe they will not,</hi> and that if they would they ſhould be able to believe and repent and obey the Goſpel. Now though we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree with the Doctor, that it is by the ſpecial diſcriminating effectual Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, that the Elect believe, repent and obey the Goſpel; and alſo that the inability and impotency which others are under to do theſe things, is a moral, and not a meer natural inability and impotence; yet to ſhow that we are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pelagians</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> we muſt declare to the World, That Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to aſcribe more to the Natural Power of an Unregenerate Man without the Grace of God, than we can allow of: This he doth in <hi>the foreſaid Book in defence of the Doctrine of the Synod of</hi> Dort, page 48.

               <p n="1">(1.) That <hi>the wicked are puniſhed for refuſing to believe;</hi> that <hi>this refuſal is the free act of their wills; and by their natural power they might abſtain from this refuſal, and might believe with an acquired Faith, as many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Men have done.</hi> And,</p>

After he had likewiſe ſhewed out of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That <hi>the reaſon why the wicked do not believe, is becauſe they will not, and that if they would, they might believe,</hi> and that ſince they <hi>might</hi> believe <hi>if they would, it is juſt with God to puniſh them ſor not believing.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) After he had ſhewed out of the ſame <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That <hi>the reaſon why they will not believe, is either becauſe they do not ſee the truth and goodneſs of that which they ſhould believe, or elſe becauſe it doth not delight them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) In the fourth place he adventures to go one ſtep further, and of his own head to ſay, That <hi>except the ſupernatural acts of the Three Theological Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Love, all Acts and Duties inward or outward are natural, and may be performed by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, though not in an acceptable manner, for want of Faith, Hope and Love ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Now</hi> (ſaith he, they are his own very words) <hi>ſuppoſe that a man were ſo exact both in natural morality, and in an outward conformity to the means of Grace, as not to fail in any particular, as he hath power to performe any particular hereof naturally; in this caſe, I ſay, if there were any ſuch, he ſhould be in the ſame caſe with thoſe that are guilty of no ſin, but ſin original,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this paſſage we obſerve that the Doctor ſuppoſeth it poſſible for a natural man by the meer power of nature, without any ſupernatural Grace to be ſo exact in doing all the Duties which God requires of him, as not to fail in any particular, and ſo to keep himſelf free from all actual Sin. He doth not indeed ſay that there is, or ever was, or ever will be ſuch a Man; but he plainly enough ſays that it is <hi>naturally poſſible,</hi> and ſuppoſes it ſo to be, he ſuppoſes it poſſible for a natural man by the power of Nature, ſo to live as to be without all actual ſin. This we are ſo far from agreeing to, that on the contrary we hold it to be <hi>naturally impoſſible</hi> for any natural man by natural power ſo to live, as to be without all actual ſin. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>original</hi> ſin in ſuch a Man would ſo vigorouſly put it ſelf forth into act upon the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93177:62"/>preſentation of outward objects to his Senſes, or the formation of Notions and Idea's of things in his mind, that by his meer natural power he could not poſſibly hinder all the Sallies and Eruptions of it.</p>
               <p>This is the Catholick Faith, and the contrary is <hi>pure Pelagianiſme,</hi> which we wonder how it ſhould ever fall from the Pen of Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> who was really a hater of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.</hi> We ſhould never have mentioned this, but to let men know how far we are from <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> even farther than Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> was, as to the power of a Natural Man. Indeed we are ſo far from thinking that a Natural Man by his meer natural powers can live without all actual ſin, that we do not believe that a Spiritual Regenerate Man can live ſo exactly as to keep himſelf free from all actual ſin, although he be furniſhed and aſſiſted with ſuch a meaſure of ſupernatural Grace, as the Lord doth ordinarily give out unto his own ſelect People. This is the Common Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, which we can demonſtrate to be true, and which we firmly believe: Surely then it muſt be a vile ſlander caſt upon us, that we are ſo far gone off from the Truth of the Reformed Religion,

               <p>

Or what is, He is the Authour of Salvation to all that obey him, but obey and live. And I demand again, what this amounts unto, whether it be any other than blaſphemy, to ſay, that the Apoſtles by ſuch their Doctrine, did not place Salvation upon a free bottom, but brought in the old Covenant again in new terms?

Again. In oppoſition to, and refutation of the eighth erroneous opinion of the <hi>Arminians</hi> they write thus,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 28, 29.</note> [<hi>We do not deny but that there is ſuch a good pleaſure of God laid open (or revealed) in the Goſpel, by which he hath decreed to chooſe Faith as a condition for conferring Salvation, that is, by which he would have the actual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Salvation, (at leaſt in reſpect of thoſe which are of ripe years,) to depend upon the condition of foregoing Faith: And this is that joyful and ſaving Meſſage to be publiſhed unto all Nations in the name of Chriſt. But this is not the very decree of Election properly taken, and ſo much ſet forth, or celebrated by the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul. <hi>For that Decree is Active or Practical, ordaining ſome particular Perſons unto Salvation, not diſpoſing of things, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things in order to Salvation, and it is confined unto, or terminated upon Humane Creatures themſelves, and not upon their qualities,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. He hath choſen us, to wit, men; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Thoſe whom he hath praedeſtinated, to wit, men, <hi>Matth:</hi> 20. <hi>Few are choſen;</hi> that is, few men. From this paſſage we obſerve, (1.) That according to thoſe Learned Divines there is an abſolute pleaſure and purpoſe of God that <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall be <hi>the condition</hi> of Salvation in the Covenant of Grace. (2.) That this abſolute pleaſure and purpoſe of God, refers to <hi>things,</hi> and abſolutely conſtitutes <hi>a conditional connexion</hi> between them, that is, between <hi>pardon of Sin and Salvation</hi> as the <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> promiſed, and <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>the condition,</hi> in whomſoever it ſhall be found. This good pleaſure and abſolute purpoſe of God terminating upon, and conſtituting <hi>the conditional connexion</hi> of things, is the foundation of the <hi>general conditional promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, which we are orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preach <hi>conditionally</hi> to all the world, as we have a Call, (<hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9.) not making any difference between Perſons and Perſons, as to that matter. But now the Decree of <hi>Election</hi> formally and terminatively conſidered, is quite another thing as to our Conception of it; It is the good pleaſure and abſolute purpoſe of God terminating upod <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> ſingling them out from others, and appointing them to obtain Salvation in ſuch a way, and by ſuch means: And this good pleaſure and purpoſe of God in his time and way according to his word of Promiſe never fails to have its powerful effect upon thoſe ſelect perſons, to make them firſt gracious, and then glorious for evermore.

               <p n="1">1. Reaſon. <hi>Salvation is a thing promiſed in the New Covenant, neither is it promiſed but upon the condition of Faith; (whoſoever believeth, ſhall be ſaved,) ſince therefore all men have not Faith in Chriſt, under which condition, only Salvation is promiſed, It is certain that the Death of Chriſt did not obtain for all, but for the faithful alone, a reſtoration (abſolute) into the ſtate of Grace and Salvation.</hi> This they prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>chap.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.</p>

               <p>Reaſon 3. <hi>If the Death of Chriſt hath obtained reſtitution for all, then are they reſtored either</hi> (1.) <hi>When Chriſt from all Eternity was deſtinated unto Death, which is falſe; for ſo no man ſhould be born a child of wrath, neither ſhould Original ſin any whit dammage mankind, being according to this Opinion forgiven them from all Eternity.</hi> — Or, (2.) <hi>They were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Perſon of our firſt Parents, when the promiſe concerning the Seed of the woman was proclaimed, which is falſe. For our firſt Parents themſelves were not reſtored into the ſtate of Grace, but by Faith in Chriſt, and conſequently neither were their Poſterity reſtored, but in like manner, that is, by Faith. Therefore not all, whether Believers, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</hi> Or, (3.) <hi>They were reſtored, when Chriſt himſelfe ſuffered Death upon the Croſs; but that is falſe alſo, and cannot be, for ſo no man before that moment ſhould have been reſtored, which none will grant: Neither are all reſtored from that time, becauſe without doubt, even at that moment, and afterward the Wrath of God burned hot againſt ſome of Chriſt's Accuſers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners, Crucifiers and Mockers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our Divines argued in the Synod, and their Arguments were approved by the Synod. Now let any man of judgment conſider the force of theſe Arguments, and he will plainly ſee that they do prove that; no Man, no, not the Elect can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into favour with God, and be juſtified before he believe, and performe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant; as well as that all men are not, and cannot be ſo dealt with. The Elect themſelves, before their Converſion are not abſolutely and actually in Grace and favour with God, they are not in a ſtate of Juſtification and Salvation, becauſe they yet want Faith the Condition of the Covenant, upon which Condition thoſe ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Bleſſings of the Covenant are only promiſed; ſo that by this we may ſee the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod hath in effect before-hand judged between us and the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and hath given Sentence according to Scripture on our ſide.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93177:64"/>
               <p>Laſtly, We find that our Divines, in the Synod, declared and proved, that Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Holy Faith and Obedience, which is the Condition of our obtaining Eternal Salvation, is it ſelf promiſed abſolutely without any proper Condition; yet not ſo as always, and in all Elect, Juſtified Perſons, to exclude and prevent a partial, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Apoſtacy and Back-ſliding. Here then are two things held by them; (1.) That the Perſeverance of the Elect, after they are once converted and juſtified, though it be a Condition of obtaining Eternal Salvation, yet it is promiſed and given without any other proper Condition. Therefore writing on the Fifth Article, they reject the erroneous Opinion of the Arminians,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> Art. V. <hi>pag.</hi> 157, 153.</note> That Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a Benefit offered equally to all the truly Faithful, upon this Condition, namely, If they ſhall not be wanting unto ſufficient Grace; and give their Reaſons why they rejected it. (1.) Say they, <hi>It is not true, that Perſeverance is a Gift onely offered, but not given: For the Scriptures witneſs, that God doth not onely offer unto his, the Grace of Perſeverance, but alſo, that he gives it them, and puts it into their Hearts:</hi> Jer. 32.40. I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me, <hi>and</hi> John 4.14. 1 Cor. 10.13. —</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>It is falſe,</hi> (ſay they,) <hi>that Perſeverance is a Grace offered, upon Condition, for it is a Gift promiſed abſolutely by God, without any reſpect to a Condition. The Reaſon is this, Some Promiſes of God are touching the End, others touching the Means which conduce to the End. The Promiſes concerning the End, that is to ſay Salvation, are conditional. Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Be faithful unto death, (that, is perſevere,) and I will give thee the Crown of Life. But foraſmuch as no Man is able to perform the Conditions, God alſo hath made moſt free and abſolute Promiſes to give the very Conditions, which he works in us, that ſo by them, as by Means, we may attain the End:</hi> Deut. 30.6. And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul, that thou maieſt live. <hi>The End here promiſed, is Life, which the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>could never attain, without the performance of the Condition, namely, their Love of God. But here God promiſeth abſolutely, that he will give unto them this very Condition. Since therefore the Promiſes of Faith, and Perſeverance in Faith, are Promiſes concerning the Means, they are wholly to be reckoned among thoſe abſolute Gifts, by which God (conſidering Mans diſability, hoth to attain the End without the Means, and alſo to perform (or effect) the Means, or Conditions of himſelf,) doth promiſe that he will make them able to performe the Conditions. God promiſeth Life to thoſe that conſtantly fear him. The Promiſe of Life is conditional, but of conſtant Fear is abſolute: I will put my fear in their hearts that they may not depart from me. And laſtly, Be it ſo, that this Gift were conditional, yet it is not offered upon this Condition, if Men will not be wanting to themſelves in the entertainment and uſe of ſufficient Grace. — F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> (1.) <hi>It will from this Condition follow, that we do in vain pray to God in the behalf of any Man, that he would give unto them the Gift of Perſeverance, becauſe of Courſe he offers them un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>erſeverance. For to perſevere, is nothing elſe, but not to be wanting unto this ſufficient Grace. If therefore God offers Perſeverance upon this Condition, he offers the ſame upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they ſhewed, that Perſeverance is abſolutely promiſed, and given, without any other proper Condition.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93177:64"/>but by Gods Mercy alone they were freed from Eternal Death, and had Life Eternal beſtowed upon them. Whilſt they cleave to ſuch ſins, and ſleep ſecurely therein, God's Fatherly Anger ariſeth againſt them,</hi> Pſal. 89.31. Rom. 2.9. <hi>Beſides, they draw upon themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Guilt; ſo that as long as they continue without Repentance, in that ſtate, they neither ought, nor can perſwade themſelves otherwiſe, than that they are ſubject to Eternal Death:</hi> Rom. 8.13. If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die. <hi>For they are bound in the Chain of a Capital Crime, by the deſert whereof, according to God's Ordinance, they are ſubject to Death, although they are not as yet given over to Death, nor about to be given over, (if we conſider the Fatherly Love of God,) but are firſt to be reſcued from this ſin, that they may alſo be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from the guilt of Death.

For the Crown of Life is not ſet upon the Head of any, but thoſe who have fought a good fight, and have finiſhed their courſe in Faith and Holineſs.</hi> (2 Tim. 4.8.) <hi>He is therefore unfit to obtain this Crown, whoſoever as yet cleaves to the</hi> Works <hi>of wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth Poſition is, <q>
                     <hi>The unalterable Ordinance of God doth require, that the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſo ſtraying out of the right way, muſt firſt return again into the way, by a renewed performance of Faith and Repentance, before he can be brought to the end of the way, that is, to the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Decree of Election, the Faithful are ſo predeſtinated to the End, that they are (as along the Kings High-way) to be led to this appointed End, no other ways than by the Means ordained by God. Nor are theſe Decrees of God, concerning the Means, Manner, and Order of ſuch Events, leſs fixed and ſure, than the Decrees of the End, and of the Events themſelves. If any Man therefore walk in a way contrary to God's Ordinance, namely, that broad way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs and Impenitence, (which leads directly down to Hell,) he can never come by this Means to the Kingdome of Heaven, yea, and if Death ſhould overtake him, wandring in this By-path, he cannot but fall into Everlaſting Death. This is the conſtant and manifeſt Voice of the Holy Scripture,</hi> Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. Be not deceived: neither fornicatours, nor idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall inherit the kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They are deceived therefore, who think that the Elect, wallowing in ſuch Crimes, and ſo dying, muſt, notwithſtanding, needs be ſaved through the force of Election. For the Salvation of the Elect is ſure indeed, God ſo decreeing: But withal (by the Decree of the ſame our God) it is not otherwiſe ſure, than by the way of Faith, Repentance, and Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God. The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, — And, Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>Again their Fifth Poſition is, that <hi>In the mean time, between the Guilt of a grievous ſin, and the Renewed Act of Faith and Repentance, ſuch an Offender ſtands by his own deſert to be condemned; by Chriſt's Merit,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> Art. V. <hi>pag.</hi> 126, 127.</note> and God's Decree to be acquitted; but actually abſolved he is not, until he hath obtained pardon by Renewed Faith and Repentance.</hi> And for Proof of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they ſay in Page 128. [<hi>The Father of Mercies hath ſet down this Order,</hi> That the Act of Repentance muſt go before the Benefit of Forgiveneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27.] Thus thoſe Excellent Divines, and Judicious, Faithful Miniſters of Chriſt. By all which, it is clear as the Sun, That the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> taught the <hi>conditionality of the Covenant,</hi> and held <hi>Faith, Repentance, ſincere Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance</hi> to the End, to be the <hi>indiſpenſably neceſſary Conditions</hi> of obtaining Eternal Salvation, and therefore if there happen to be a partial Intermiſſion of ſincere Evangelical Obedience, for a time, by Chriſtians falling into hainous wilful ſins, there muſt be a renewing of Faith and Repentance, and a returning to their Obedience again, before they can obtain the pardon of thoſe Sins, and the Eternal Salvation of their Souls; which is all that we hold in this matter.</p>
               <p>And it is alſerted, explained, and ſolidly proved, by the moſt Learned and Judicious <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                  </hi>) in another Book of his, in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93177:65"/>theſe Words, <hi>Bond Opera ſunt neceſſaria ad Juſtificationis ſtatum reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendum,

                        <hi>Praelect. de Juſtitiâ Habit. &amp; Act. cap.</hi> 31. <hi>p.</hi> 404, 405.</note> &amp; conſervandum, non ut cauſae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that is, Good Workes are neceſſary to retain, and preſerve the ſtate of Juſtification, not as cauſes which of themſelves, effect, produce, or merit this Preſervation, but as Means or</hi> Conditions, <hi>without which God will not preſerve the Grace of Juſtification in Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here may be reckoned up the ſame Works which we mentioned in the foregoing Concluſion: For as no Man receives that general Juſtification, which froes from the Guilt of all former ſins, unleſs Repentance, Faith, a Purpoſe to lead a New Life, and other Actions of that nature, concurre: So no Man retains a ſtate free from Guilt, with reſpect to following ſins, but by means of the ſame Actions, of believing in God, calling upon God, mortifying the fleſh, continually repenting and grieving for the ſins that are continually committed. The Reaſon why all theſe things are neceſſarily required on our part, is this, becauſe theſe things cannot be always abſent, but their contraries will begin to be preſent, which are repugnant to the Nature of a juſtified Man: For if you take away Faith in God and Prayer, there ſucceeds unbelief, and contempt of God's Name: If you take away the endeavour of Mortification, and the exerciſe of Repentance, there breaks in upon the Man, predominant Luſts, and Sins waſting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Therefore becauſe it is not God's will, that Men, who are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, obſtinate, carnal, ſhould enjoy the benefit of Juſtification, he requires continual Works of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Mortification; by whoſe preſence, are thruſt, as it were, out of Doors, and driven far away, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, Obſtinacy, Security, and other Poyſons of Juſtifying Grace; and alſo of particular ſins, there is a particular pardon obtained. Hence</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> (Rom. 8.13.) If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: <hi>And</hi> Heb. 3.12. Take heed, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. <hi>We do not therefore think, that the Act it ſelf of believing, repenting, and mortifying the fleſh doth effect, or merit the conſervation of Juſtifying Grace; becauſe all theſe things are done by us faintly and imperfectly, ſometimes alſo, through the Prevalency of ſome great Tentation, they are, as it were, choaked and oppreſſed; but we ſay, that God himſelf, of his free Mercy, preſerves the Regenerate in a ſtate of Grace and Salvation, whilſt they walk in theſe wayes. As therefore for the preſervation of Natural Life, it is neceſſarily required, that a Man care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid Fire, Water, Precipices, Poyſons, and other things which deſtroy the Health of the Body; ſo for the preſervation of Spiritual Life, it is neceſſarily required, that a Man avoid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, Impenitency, and other things that are deſtructive, and contrary to the Salvation of Souls; which cannot be avoided, unleſs the oppoſite and contrary Actions be exerciſed. But theſe Actions do not preſerve the Life of Grace properly and of themſelves, by touching (or producing) the very effect it ſelf of preſervation, but improperly and by accident, by excluding and removing the cauſe of deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have at large refuted the Authour of the Letter, his <hi>Second Errour</hi> againſt <hi>the Purity of Chriſtian Faith;</hi> and have fully and clearly proved <hi>the Covenant of Grace to be Conditional.</hi> This we have done, <hi>firſt,</hi> by clear <hi>Scripture: Secondly,</hi> by certain and evident <hi>Reaſon</hi> grounded upon Scripture: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of Orthodox Divines, and <hi>Firſt,</hi> by Teſtimonies of the <hi>Antient Doctors</hi> of the Primitive Church: <hi>Secondly,</hi> by Teſtimonies of Divines of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> both at Home and Abroad; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, by the Teſtimony of the Divines of the Famous Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Whence it is as clear as the Sun, that we preach no new Arminian Goſpel, in this great Point of the Covenant of Grace; and conſequently, that <hi>the Authour of the Letter is a falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Matter of Fact,</hi> who hath proclaimed us to the World, to be Preachers of a new Arminian Goſpel, on the account of our Doctrine in the point of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>If after all this, he ſhould ſay that though we have proved the Covenant to be <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and Faith to be the receptive applicative condition of it; yet we have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Faith juſtifies as a Condition;</hi> We Anſwer, That look by what place of Scripture he ſhall ever be able to prove that Faith juſtifies as an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and a hand by the ſame ſhall we prove that Faith juſtifies <hi>as a receptive applicative condition.</hi> For (as we ſaid before) we take <hi>a receptive applicative Condition,</hi> and <hi>a moral foederal inſtrument</hi> to be <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>the ſame thing.</hi> So did the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly</hi> of Divines before us: And in this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93177:65"/>ſenſe (which <hi>alone</hi> is juſtifiable) we hold <hi>Faith</hi> to be both <hi>an Inſtrument</hi> and a <hi>Condition</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Juſtification.</hi> And if that will pleaſe our Authour, we ſhall grant him that Faith is <hi>a hand,</hi> and not only a hand, but <hi>an eye</hi> and <hi>a mouth</hi> too; <hi>an eye</hi> to look unto Chriſt crucified, <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22.

               <p>We ſhall conclude this Anſwer with the Teſtimony of Two Learneder and Wiſer Men than our Authour ſeems to be. The <hi>firſt</hi> is the Reverend Mr. <hi>Lukin,</hi> a Worthy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Congregational Miniſter in his <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> printed above Thirty years ago.
<note place="margin">Lukin<hi>'s Life of Faith. p.</hi> 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>For the queſtion about the Intereſt of Faith in our Juſtification, whether it juſtifie as an Inſtrument, or as a Condition. I think (ſaith he) it deſerves not half the words that have been uſed about it, they are both of them School-terms, and not found in the Scripture, and ſhould not therefore diſturb the peace of the Church, eſpecially ſeeing both Parties at variance, are agreed in the thing, but not in the formal notion, under which they do conceive it; and I think both lides are ſo far agreed, that Faith may be called an Inſtrument; allowing much impropriety of ſpeech, and that it may be called a Condition, while we thereby do not ſuppoſe any ſuch thing as merit.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Lukin.</hi> Now we heartily accept of this expedient; for the calming of the Tempeſt which <hi>the Letter</hi> hath raiſed. We will never deſire <hi>the Authour</hi> to call Faith <hi>a meritorious condition,</hi> (for we never called it ſo our ſelves,) if he will grant us that it is but <hi>improperly an Inſtrument</hi> of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>The other is the Learned <hi>Turretin,</hi> that famous <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity lately at <hi>Geneva,</hi> who writes thus, <hi>Caeterum non anxiè quaerendum putamus, an fides inſtrumenti notionem induat in hoc negotio,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Turretin. <hi>Inſtit. part.</hi> 2. <hi>loc.</hi> 16. <hi>quaeſt</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 737.</note> 
                  <hi>But we do not think that it is curiouſly to be enquired after, whether Faith put on the nation of an Inſtrument in this matter of Juſtification; or likewiſe of a condition, as it ſeems to ſome men. For nothing hinders, but both notions may be aſcribed to it; provided, Condition be not taken for that, in conſideration whereof God juſtifies Man in the Covenant of Grace; after the manner that works were the Condition of Juſtification in the Legal Covenant: For in this ſenſe, it cannot be called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unleſs we come over to the</hi> Socinians <hi>and</hi> Arminians, <hi>who will have Faith or the Act of believing to be accepted by God for perfect Righteouſneſs, which we have but now reſuted: But taking the word</hi> Condition <hi>in a large ſenſe for all that which is required on our part to obtain that benefit, whether it have the notion of a cauſe properly ſo called, or only of an inſtrumental Cauſe; for as that Condition hath the relation of an Inſtrument, ſo that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the nature of a Condition on our part, without which Juſtification cannot be obtained.</hi> Thus <hi>Turretin</hi> to which we fully agree, except that we think he gives <hi>too much</hi> to <hi>Faith</hi> in conceiving it to be <hi>an inſtrumental cauſe</hi> of Juſtification, yet ſince he ſays that it is <hi>no cauſe properly ſo called,</hi> it follows neceſſarily that it is not properly an inſtrumental cauſe, and ſo hath no proper cauſal influence upon the act of Juſtification; and if ſo then it is but <hi>improperly an inſtrument,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lukin</hi> ſaith, and ſo the whole Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie comes to nothing but a ſtrife about <hi>the propriety,</hi> or <hi>impropriety</hi> of a word; which <hi>Turretin</hi> plainly ſaw, and therefore confeſſed that <hi>Faith is ſo an Inſtrument, as to be a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo a Condition as to be an Inſtrument of Juſtification:</hi> And taking the word <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>a moral Senſe,</hi> for a means of receiving the benefit of Juſtification for Chriſt's ſake only, we do unfeignedly affirm, as <hi>Turretin</hi> doth, that a ſincere Faith is both the Inſtrument and Receptive Condition of Juſtification.</p>

               <p>HIS Third Errour againſt the Purity of our Chriſtian Faith is, That the Lord doth <hi>not</hi> by preventing Grace <hi>prepare, diſpoſe,</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> his People for their <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> by and for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them, but that his <hi>firſt</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work towards them and upon them, is <hi>their Juſtification</hi> by Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Error</hi> 3.</note> That this is his Opinion, is evident from his own words. For in <hi>page</hi> 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32. He denyes, <hi>That there can be any qualification in us, that any real change is wrought upon us, that any condition is required of us in order to our Juſtification;</hi> he will not ſo much as admit of <hi>Repentance as a diſpoſitive Condition in order thereunto;</hi> and often finds fault with us for holding Faith to be a Qualification or <hi>the Condition of Juſtification,</hi> though he knew well enough that we hold it to be only the <hi>receptive, applicative Condition of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs</hi> in order to our being juſtified thereby. Now that this Opinion is <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,</hi> and againſt <hi>the purity</hi> of our Chriſtian Faith we ſhall prove. (1.) By <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> (2.) By <hi>Reaſon</hi> agreeable to Scripture. (3.) By the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Orthodox, Proteſtant Divines. But before we come to our Proofs, we premiſe a few things to give light unto what ſhall follow: As, (1.) That we hold the priority of any preparation, diſpoſition, qualification, or condition before Juſtification, <hi>no farther</hi> than is neceſſary to verifie the Expreſſions of Holy Scripture concerning them. (2.) We hold that they proceed from the Grace of God. (3.) That that Grace is from Jeſus Chriſt by the ſupernatural influences of his Holy Spirit. (4.) That ſome of thoſe things whereby the Spirit of Chriſt prepares and diſpoſes Souls before they be juſtified, are ſuch as by the Conſtitution and Ordination of God have a neceſſary infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with <hi>Juſtification,</hi> they are diſpoſitions or qualifications <hi>(ſine quibus nunquam &amp; cum quibus ſemper juſtificamur,)</hi> without which we are never, and with which we are always juſtified; of this ſort is <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> and what is commonly called <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> or that ſeminal abiding Principle of Spiritual Life, which is communicated unto us in Effectual Calling, and the new Birth together with the firſt vital actings of that Principle in Faith and Repentance. That Seminal Principle of Spiritual Life, with its firſt Vital Acts of Faith and Repentance, doth according to our Judgment, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and diſpoſe, and qualifie the Soul for Juſtification, that it is always infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them according to the Word and Promiſe of God, and it is never in any caſe without them; and let it be always remembred, that in our Opinion Actual Faith qualifies us as a receptive Condition of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. But we think alſo, that there are other diſpoſitions antecedent to Juſtification which have not ſuch a neceſſary Connexion with Juſtification, and yet they are from God's Spirit too. (5.) That the ſaid Seminal Principle of Spiritual Life, with its firſt Vital Acts of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which are in order before Juſtification, and upon which Juſtification always follows; is the firſt beginning of Holineſs, and may well be called Initial Sanctification; for it is the Holy Thing firſt begotten in us by God's Word and Spirit, it is the firſt forming of Chriſt in us, and it is the Holy Root, or Seed, out of which grows our Progreſſive Sanctification, through the Influences and Operations of the Holy Spirit, given us after Juſtification, to dwell in us, and to abide with us for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things premiſed, we ſhall prove, firſt by <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it is <hi>an Errour</hi> to deny that there is any real change in us, that there can be any Qualification, or Diſpoſition wrought in us by the Grace of Chriſt antecedently, (at leaſt in order of Nature,) to our Juſtification by the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. For doth not the Scripture expreſly put Effectual Calling before our Juſtification? Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom God called,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93177:66"/>them he alſo juſtified?</hi> Now it is confeſſed, that it is an inward Effectual Calling that is there ſpoken of; and that ſuch a Calling makes a real change in the Perſons ſo called. But ſo it is that this Calling is by the Spirit of God put <hi>before</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Again, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, 17. there we have the Order of God's beſtowing on his Select People the Bleſſings of the New Covenant. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with them after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Here we ſee, that the Lord according to his Covenant, <hi>firſt</hi> writes his Laws in the Hearts of his People, (which cannot be without ſome real change wrought on them, and ſome Holy Principle put into them;) <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Sins and Iniquities he remembers no more; and that is, he Juſtifies them, for pardon of ſin is an eſſential part of Juſtification, and is put for the whole, by a Form of Speech uſual enough in the Scriptures of Truth. Further, our Saviour himſelf gives us plainly to underſtand, that this is the order of his diſpenſing his Saving Grace, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12. <hi>Leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi> In which Words our Lord plainly intimates, that the ſins of the unbelieving Jews were not forgiven them, that is, they were <hi>not juſtified, becauſe</hi> they were <hi>not converted;</hi> and that whomſoever he pardons and juſtifies, he <hi>firſt</hi> converts them. And ſure Converſion imports a real change, and a Principle of Grace and Holineſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Souls of the Converted. This is yet clearer from the Words of our Lord to <hi>Paul,</hi> recorded by <hi>Luke, Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>I ſend thee unto the Gentiles to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. By forgiveneſs of ſins is meant <hi>Juſtification,</hi> becauſe forgiveneſs of ſins is an eſſential part of Juſtification; before the Gentiles could attain to this Juſtification, conſiſting in the forgiveneſs of their ſins, their eyes were to be opened, and they were to be turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Is it not then ſelf-evident, that the Gentiles were to be really changed from what they had been in former times, and that they muſt be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> and become <hi>new Creatures,</hi> before they could obtain the Bleſſing and Benefit of <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification?</hi> It is a wonder to us, that any Man ſhould doubt of this Matter, who believes the Scripture, and conſiders the form of Words uſed there by the Holy Writer, which plainly ſets forth the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the Gentiles as <hi>an End,</hi> and <hi>their Converſion</hi> from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, as <hi>a Means</hi> to attain that End. Now <hi>the Means</hi> is always in execution <hi>before</hi> the <hi>End:</hi> Conſequently, <hi>Converſion</hi> is, and muſt be <hi>before Juſtification.</hi> And if ſo, then there is <hi>a real change</hi> in the Soul <hi>before</hi> Juſtification; the Perſon to be <hi>juſtified</hi> is <hi>prepared, diſpoſed,</hi> and <hi>qualified</hi> by <hi>converting Grace,</hi> in order of nature, at leaſt <hi>before</hi> he be Juſtified: And till he be ſo <hi>changed</hi> by converting Grace, he is <hi>not capable</hi> of being <hi>Juſtified,</hi> according to Gods Order of diſpenſing Saving Grace unto his People. This our Authour ſaw well enough,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lett. pag.</hi> 16.</note> when he quoted <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>to prove that a Man is to believe, that he may be Juſtified.</hi> For that plainly ſhews, that Faith is a Means to obtain Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and all the World knows, that the Means is always firſt in execution (as hath been ſaid) before the End be thereby obtained. Now we demand, if a Man muſt have <hi>Faith before</hi> he be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> muſt there not be a real change in him, muſt he not be changed from being <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> and muſt he not alſo be <hi>initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſanctified?</hi> Is not true Faith a Holy Vertue, and doth it not denominate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, to be <hi>ſo far holy,</hi> as he is a <hi>true Believer? Peter</hi> ſaith, that ſincere Faith is a <hi>pretious thing,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1 and <hi>Jude v.</hi> 20. affirms that our Faith is a <hi>moſt holy faith,</hi> and it is true, both of <hi>the object</hi> of our Faith, the things which we believe; and of <hi>our Faith it ſelf,</hi> the <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> whereby we do believe, both are holy: And how can it be but <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be <hi>holy,</hi> ſince it is one of <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22.? And ſurely nothing but what is holy, can be a Fruit of the Holy Spirit. From all which we may confidently conclude, that <hi>ſomething</hi> which is <hi>holy,</hi> is <hi>wrought in</hi> us,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93177:67"/>and <hi>by</hi> us, <hi>before</hi> we be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> for it is wrought in us, and by us, <hi>that we may be Juſtified.</hi> Thus we learn from Scripture, that by preventing, converting Grace there is a real change wrought in the Soul <hi>before</hi> we be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> that that change is from falſehood to truth, from evil to good, and that thereby the Perſon to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ied of an <hi>unholy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever</hi> becomes an <hi>holy Believer,</hi> and ſo is a Subject <hi>capable</hi> of being immediately <hi>juſtified</hi> by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to him upon his <hi>Converſion,</hi> and <hi>penitent believing.</hi> And here we might further demonſtrate, that there are, through Grace, ſome holy Diſpoſitions wrought in the Soul <hi>before</hi> Juſtification, by all thoſe Scriptures that put <hi>Repentance before Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> but this we have done already, when we proved ſincere Repentance to be a diſpoſitive Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Therefore we paſs from this Firſt, to our <hi>Second</hi> Head of Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We prove by Reaſon agreeable to Scripture, that it is an Errour <hi>to deny that there is any real change, that there can be any holy qualification, or Diſpoſition, wrought in us by the Grace of God, antecedently to our Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Firſt we reaſon thus. Faith is a <hi>Condition</hi> of Juſtification, as we have proved at large, therefore it may well be a <hi>qualification</hi> of the Perſon to be juſtified; and we much wonder, that our Authour ſhould boldly deny the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of any ſuch qualification. For it is <hi>leſs</hi> to be a <hi>Qualification,</hi> than to be a <hi>Condition:</hi> If then Faith <hi>be a Condition,</hi> it may much more be a <hi>Qualification.</hi> And that for Faith to be a Qualification is leſs than to be a Condition, is hence evident, becauſe <hi>Faith,</hi> as the Gift of God, without any Act of ours, may be <hi>a Qualification;</hi> but to make it <hi>a proper Condition,</hi> it muſt be our own free Act receiving Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, though produced by the ſtrength of God's Special Grace. Now it is plainly leſs for us to be the <hi>Subjects</hi> only <hi>paſſively</hi> receiving the Gift of Faith, than to be <hi>the Agents</hi> freely producing the Act, and performing the Condition of Faith. Although then our Authour might ſeem to have ſome Reaſon to doubt, whether <hi>Faith</hi> be the <hi>proper Condition</hi> of the Covenant, with reſpect to Juſtification; yet we cannot imagine why be ſhould deny, that it can poſſibly be a <hi>Qualification</hi> of the Perſon to be juſtified; for it is very eaſily conceivable, that it may be ſuch a Qualification, as it is a Grace given unto, and wrought in the Perſon to be Juſtified, on purpoſe that he may be thereby qualified for the great and bleſſed Priviledge of Juſtification. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility is there in all this, That God ſhould conſtitute, and ordain, that <hi>none</hi> thould ever be Juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but thoſe that are <hi>ſo qualified;</hi> and that Faith ſhall be the Qualification: And then becauſe no Man can by his natural power qualify himſelf with this Faith, that God for Chriſts ſake ſhould by his Spirit give Saving Faith unto all his Select People, and ſpecial Favourites, and thereby <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie</hi> them for <hi>Juſtification?</hi> We can ſee no Shadow of Repugnancy and Impoſſibility, but that God may do this if he pleaſe. And when he hath done it, when he hath qualified a Man with <hi>faith,</hi> he moſt certainly hath a Qualification for the Benefit of Juſtification. And this is ſo far from darkning the Glory of God's free Grace in Chriſt, that on the contrary, it greatly ſets it forth, and illuſtrates it, that God will not only freely promiſe Juſtification, through Chriſt, unto all that are qualified with true faith; but that for Chriſt's ſake he freely gives them that <hi>faith,</hi> and doth himſelf <hi>qualifie</hi> them therewith. The like we ſay of <hi>Repentance,</hi> it is a Qualification of God's own ordaining, and of God's own giving. Nor doth Faith and Repentance their being Conditions, hinder their being Qualifications, for they may be, and are both. All that we have hitherto aſcribed to Repentance in order to Juſtification, is to be a diſpoſitive Condition of the Subject, and that is the ſame thing with a qualifying Condition, and a qualifying Condition is a Qualification. We have indeed given more to faith, for according to the Scripture we have owned it to be the only recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, applicative Condition of Juſtification, which is more than to be, either a meer Qualification, or a meer Condition; for neither is Qualification, nor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meerly as Qualification, and as Condition, receptive and applicative of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs unto Juſtification. To be ſo receptive and applicative is not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93177:67"/>eſſential to the general notion of a Condition; but to the <hi>ſpecial</hi> notion of <hi>ſuch a</hi> condition. And yet this receptive applicative nature of Faith <hi>as ſuch a ſpecial condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> doth not at all hinder it from being a qualification of the Perſon to be juſtified. For the ſame Faith in different reſpects is capable of different Notions: Or if any ſhould doubt of that, (without juſt reaſon we think) to ſatisfie them we may well ſay (what is a great truth) that the habitual Seminal Principle of Faith is a qualification of the Perſon to be juſtified; and that the actual Exerciſe of Faith is the receptive applicative Condition of Juſtification. This is our firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The ſeminal abiding Principle of Faith is a holy diſpoſition of the Soul whereby it is inclined and fitted to elicit and produce the Acts of Faith. This is clear, becauſe it is in a ſpecial manner the gift of a Holy God, and the fruit of his Holy Spirit, who cannot be the Authour of any Seed, Diſpoſition, Inclination, or Habit in the Soul of Man, but what is good and Holy. But now that Seminal abiding Principle of Faith is before Juſtification. This is clear as the Sun, becauſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Act of that Faith whereby alone we are ſaid to be juſtified; and that it is before the juſtifying act of faith, we thus demonſtrate, That which concurs to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the Act, is before the act, ſince it is in part the cauſe of the act, and the cauſe as ſuch muſt always be in order of Nature at leaſt, before the effect, and it implies a contradiction that it ſhould be otherwiſe. But the Seminal abiding Principle of Faith, concurs to the producing of the Act of juſtifying Faith, for it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us for that end that it may fit us for, inclines us to, and help us in acting. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is before the Act of juſtifying Faith, and conſequently before Juſtification it ſelf. Here then we have found a Holy Seed and Principle put by God into the Soul before Juſtification. And therefore it is utterly falſe which the Letter ſaith, that there neither is nor can be any good or holy thing in the Soul, or any real change wrought on the Soul before Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The Act of Juſtifying Faith is a good and holy thing, ſince it is the effect of God's Holy Spirit, and the firſt Fruit of the foreſaid Holy Seed of Faith in the Soul. But ſo it is that even according to our Authours own Principles the Act of Faith is before Juſtification. For (as was obſerved before) he ſays <hi>out of Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We believe that we may be juſtified;</hi> and if ſo, then it is evident that our believing is in order of Nature at leaſt, before we be juſtified. (2.) He holds <hi>that Faith is the Inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification,</hi> and lays great ſtreſs upon that Notion, as if it were the great fundamental of his Religion; he likewiſe finds great fault with us for not holding with him that Faith is the Inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Opinion of his, he cannot avoid the placing of the Act of Faith before Juſtification, becauſe it is the Act of Faith that receives Chriſt and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that is the inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification. But all the World knows that every proper cauſe (as an inſtrumental cauſe is in its kind) is in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before its effect: Either then ſome holy good thing is in us before Juſtification, or Actual Faith is no holy good thing; and his inſtrument wherewith he makes ſuch a noiſe is good for nothing, but to blow the Coals of Strife and Contention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Before a Man can be juſtified by Faith, there muſt be a real and holy change in him, becauſe of an Unbeliever he muſt become a Believer, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without a real change, and a holy one too. Now that a Man from being an Unbeliever muſt come to be a Believer in Chriſt before he can be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, is ſelf-evident, for how can a Man be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, who yet hath no Faith in Chriſt, he muſt then have Faith, before he can be juſtified by Faith. But how ſhall he get this Faith? Can he get Faith, whilſt he ſtill remains in Unbelief that is impoſſible. For Unbelief either ſignifies not believing, or it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies poſitive disbelieving; and (1.) If it ſignifie not believing, it ſtands in a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory oppoſition to believing; and contradictions are utterly inconſiſtent. Can a Man believe in Chriſt, and not at all believe in Chriſt at the ſame time? We hope our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour will not be ſo ridiculous as to go about to reconcile contradictions.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93177:68"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) If Unbelief ſignifie poſitive disbelieving, disbelieving in power and prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then it ſtands in a contrary oppoſition to believing, and two contraries in power and prevalency are likewiſe utterly inconſiſtent in the ſame ſubject at the ſame time. A Man that is in the very Act of poſitive disbelief; and under the power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of it, cannot poſſibly have an actual Faith in Chriſt at that time. Therefore that an Unbeliever may get actual Faith in Chriſt and be juſtified by that Faith, he muſt of neceſſity be changed, really and effectually changed; he muſt be changed from being an Unbeliever, to be a Believer; he muſt come off from his ſin of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, or of disbelieving, unto the practice of his Duty of believing in Chriſt that he may be juſtified by Faith; But this cannot poſſibly be without a real change; nay this coming off from the ſin of Unbelief, to the Duty of Believing is a real change, and a holy change too, therefore there is and muſt be a real holy change in Man in order of Nature at leaſt before his Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt. This is as certain and evident, as that Two and Two make Four. Yet our Authour finds fault with us for making it a part <hi>of our new Scheme that there muſt be a real change in a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>let. page</hi> 30.</note> that he muſt be changed from his Unbelief, that he may come to Chriſt by Faith for Juſtification. And elſewhere he ſays, That <hi>it is the experience of every Believer, that every one who believeth on Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>page</hi> 11.</note> acts that Faith as the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> And if ſo, then it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that every one who believes on Chriſt, acts that Faith as an Unbeliever, for according to him <hi>unbelief is the chiefeſt ſin,</hi> ſo he writes expreſly, That <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is the moſt provoking to God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>page</hi> 15, 16.</note> and the moſt damning to man, of all ſins.</hi> Unbelief then is the chiefeſt ſin; and if ſo, certainly the Unbeliever muſt be the chiefeſt Sinner, and the Believer who acts his Faith as the chief of Sinners muſt act his Faith as an Unbeliever: And that is a very odd way of acting Faith, to believe as an Unbeliever. Yet no man can help it, for if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Doctrine be true, it muſt be ſo, and cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe <hi>it is that which the experience of all Believers witneſſeth unto;</hi> and as he writes, <hi>page</hi> 24. <hi>The Believer or Accepter of Chriſt, in the very act of believing or accepting of Chriſt, expreſly diſclaims all things in himſelf, but ſinfulneſs and miſery:</hi> And if he do ſo, then he diſclaims, that is, renounces his Faith it ſelf in the very act of believing. He doth not diſclaim his Unbelief, for that is ſin; nor doth he diſclaim the conceit of meriting Juſtification by his Faith, for that is a ſinful conceit: But he diſclaims his Faith it ſelf, unleſs his Faith be either ſinfulneſs or miſery; for he diſclaims all things in himſelf, but ſinfulneſs and miſery: Theſe two, to wit, Sinfulneſs and miſery, are the only things which he doth not diſclaim: Whence it follows neceſſarily, that he diſclaims his belief it ſelf in the very act of believing; and ſo by this means he is enabled to believe as an Unbeliever. This is (it may be) one of our Authours deep Myſteries, for which his Proſelytes admire him, and hug his Letter. And we confeſs there is no ſuch deep Myſtery as the Myſtery of contradictious Non-ſenſe. But if every one who believes, doth believe as the chief of Sinners, and ſo believes as an Unbeliever, and as one that diſclaims all true and ſaving Faith, we would know how it comes to paſs that all the Unbelievers in the World do not believe; one would think that they might all eaſily believe with ſuch a Faith as is acted by a Man (under that reduplicating <hi>quatenus</hi>) as an Unbeliever, and which, in the very act of believing renounceth all ſaving belief, even every thing but Sin and Miſery. Of old no Man was received into the Chriſtian Church, and accounted a Chriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he firſt diſclaimed and renounced his ſins; but now it ſeems there is a great alteration in the ſtate of Chriſtianity; for a man cannot at this day be a Chriſtian, unleſs he diſclaim (<hi>or which is all one</hi> renounce) his Chriſtian Faith, and that too with an exception of not diſclaiming his ſins. If this be the only way to be a Chriſtian, one would think that all the <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> in the World might eaſily be Chriſtians, for they can eaſily believe with a Faith, that in the very act of it,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93177:68"/>renounces and diſclaims Faith, but not ſin. But if our Authour ſay that every true Chriſtian muſt believe in Chriſt with a ſincere and ſaving Faith, which Unbelievers have not, and yet at the ſame time he muſt act his Faith as an Unbeliover, and in the very act of Faith, he muſt diſclaim his Faith, but not his Sin of Unbelief; and that there muſt be no real change in him from Unbelief to Faith, till he have Faith, and have acted his Faith as aforeſaid, and be juſtified by ſuch an Act of Faith; and then a real change paſſes upon him in order of Nature after his Juſtification, but not before. We anſwer, That this is contradictious Non-ſenſe, and at this rate no man can be a Chriſtian till he hath made both ends of a contradiction meet, and hath verified both parts of a contradiction in his own Perſon; no man can be a Chriſtian that is really changed from being an Unbeliever to be a Believer; no, he cannot be a Chriſtian till he be both an Unbeliever and Believer in predominant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees at the ſame time, without any real change from what he was by Nature: The plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of this is that according to the Principles of our Authour laid down in his Letter, no Man can ever be a good Chriſtian at all, for the thing is impoſſible, becauſe it implies a manifeſt contradiction. Yet we muſt be ſo charitable as to think that our Authour hath indeed greatly miſtaken in the expreſſing of his mind in his Letter; but that really he doth not believe thoſe things himſelf. We hope he is of a more Orthodox Faith, and are willing to impute it to ſome inadvertency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs in the haſty writing of his Letter. We think he would or ſhould have ſaid that every one who believes on Jeſus Chriſt, acts that Faith, as one who thinks himſelf to have been formerly before his Converſion and Faith, a chief of Sinners, or one of the firſt rank of great Sinners. But doth not think himſelf to be ſtill in the ſame ſtate of Unregeneracy and Unbelief; for if he think ſo of himſelf after that is converted and is actually believing on Chriſt, moſt certainly <hi>he thinks amiſs</hi> whatever <hi>our Authour</hi> ſay to the contrary; for he thinks falſly of himſelf, and ſins in ſo thinking. <hi>Our Authour</hi> talks confidently of that which he doth not know, to wit, the experience of every Believer, for certainly he was never acquainted with the experiences of the thouſandth part of Believers that are in the Chriſtian Church at this day. Can he then <hi>ſay in Faith</hi> that it is the experience of <hi>every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> that he acts his Faith as one who in former times hath been as great a Sinner, and hath done as much diſhonour to God, and as much miſchief to the Church and to the World, <hi>as the preſent King of</hi> France? But whatever he ſay or think of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; we are perſwaded that true Believers are taught of God, <hi>as to be humble, ſo to be wiſe in acting their Faith; wiſer</hi> (we are confident) than that every one of them ſhould think himſelf to be ſo great a Sinner as that he hath done as much diſhonour to God, and miſchief to the Church of Chriſt, as <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth</hi> has done, and ſtill continues to do. Again when he ſays, that a Believer and accepter of Chriſt in the very act of believing and accepting, expreſly diſclaims all things in himſelf, but Sin and Miſery; we think he ſhould have ſaid that he either expreſly, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, formally or virtually in the very act of Believing diſclaims all things in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as being <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from himſelf,</hi> but Sin and Miſery, which are indeed of and from himſelf, and he takes the ſhame and blame thereof upon himſelf; but as for his Faith, or any good diſpoſition or qualification that is in him, he aſcribes it all to the free Grace of God, and gives God all the Glory of it: And after the ſame manner in the very act of believing, in order of Nature before he be juſtified, he virtually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to God's Glory, that by his Grace he hath wrought a real Holy Change in his Soul, and of a blind, proud Unbeliever, hath made him an underſtanding, humble Believer according to that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding that we may know him that is true.</hi>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. Fifthly and laſtly. The Seminal vital principle of juſtifying Faith is ſeated in the heart, and the firſt vital act of it comes from the heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believes unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> We demand then concerning the firſt vital act of juſtifying Faith, either it comes from a renewed Heart, or an unrenewed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93177:69"/>Heart, a Regenerate Heart, of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>regenerate Heart, a Heart of Fleſh, or an Heart of Stone; or if it come not from either of theſe, then it muſt come from <hi>a third,</hi> that is from a Heart that is neither renewed nor unrenewed, neither regenerate, nor unregenerate, neither of Fleſh, nor of Stone, But now,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The firſt vital act of Juſtifying Faith cannot come from a Heart that is neither renewed, nor unrenewed, neither regenerate, nor unregenerate, for there is no ſuch Heart in any Man, nor indeed can there be any ſuch Heart: For renewed, and not at all renewed, regenerate, and not at all regenerate, are contradictions which admit of no medium. Every Heart of Man then in the whole World muſt be one of theſe, but cannot be both at once, nor any <hi>third thing</hi> diſtinct from both; for there is no middle between the two, betweenrenewed, and not at all renewed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since then, every Heart of Man in the World cannot be both renewed, and not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed at the ſame time, nor yet be any third thing, but muſt be either one or other,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We ſay in the ſecond place, That the firſt vital act of Juſtifying Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come from an Heart not at all renewed, nor regenerate. For a vital act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith is too good and precious Fruit to grow upon the corrupt Tree of a Heart wholly unrenewed and unregenerate. Our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16, 17, 18. give us to underſtand, that we may with as much reaſon expect to gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles, as that a vital act of precious juſtifying Faith ſhould come from a Heart that is altogether unregenerate and unrenewed. It remains then in the third place, that ſince the firſt vital act of juſtifying Faith cannot come from a Heart that is altogether unrenewed and unregenerate, that is all ſtony, hard, and obſtinately bent unto evil; It muſt of neceſſity come from a Heart that is at leaſt partly renewed and regenerate, partly Fleſh, or tender and pliable to the Will of God? And from this it follows unavoidably, that there muſt be a real, holy change wrought in the Heart of Man before his Juſtification by faith; for the Heart of Man cannot poſſibly be renewed and regenerated either in part, or in whole, without ſome real holy change wrought in it; but it is renewed and regenerated in part at leaſt in order of Nature, before the firſt vital act of juſtifying faith, as hath been proved; and that firſt vital act of faith is in order of Nature before juſtification by faith; therefore there is and muſt be ſome real holy change wrought in the Heart before juſtification by faith: From all which it is evident that the Opinion of our Authour is erroneous, and againſt the purity of our Chriſtian faith, to wit, that there is no real change, no holy diſpoſition or qualification before Juſtification by faith: And that on the contrary there is and muſt be a real change of the Heart, there are and muſt be ſeveral holy diſpoſitions and qualifications wrought in the Soul by the Word and Spirit of the Lord, before we can be juſtified by faith, and our ſins can be actually and abſolutely forgiven us. This we have clearly proved both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and by Reaſon agreeable to Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now in the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> place, we ſhall prove it by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of famous and orthodox Proteſtant Divines: We begin with <hi>Calvin,</hi> who (as was ſhewn before) in his Commentary on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 23. ſaith, <hi>(Praecedit veniam poenitentia, quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum hîc dicitur:) That Repentance goes before pardon of ſin, as it is ſaid to doe, in this place of Scripture.</hi> Whence we obſerve, (1.) That it is not a meer legal Repentance, ſuch as may be in an unconverted Man that he ſpeaks of; but it is <hi>an Evangelical ſaving Repentance;</hi> for <hi>firſt,</hi> it is a Repentance that conſiſts in turning from ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 23. yea from all ſin in Heart and Affection, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in doing the whole known will of God, that is, doing it in deſire and reſolution, <hi>v.</hi> 21. But a meer legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth not conſiſt in theſe things, nor hath it ſo good an effect upon the Soul. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a Repentance to which Pardon and Life is promiſed through Chriſt. But no ſuch thing is promiſed to a meer legal Repentance: Therefore it is not a Legal, but an Evangelical Repentance, that <hi>Calvin</hi> there ſpeaks of. (2.) We obſerve, that if in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment a true Evangelical Repentance goes before pardon of ſin and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93177:69"/>Juſtification, then a true juſtifying faith goes before it alſo. For <hi>Calvin</hi> was clearly of the opinion, that faith goes before a true Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in ſo much that he ſaies,

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Words of <hi>Calvin</hi> manifeſtly ſhew, that he held <hi>faith</hi> to be in order of nature <hi>before</hi> true <hi>Evangelical Repentance;</hi> which we muſt thus underſtand, (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) that the ſeminal Principle of Faith, with ſome of its Acts, to wit, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Act, is before any Act of true Evangelical Repentance, and not that all the Acts of juſtifying faith are before any one Act of true Evangelical Repentance; otherwiſe we ſhall make <hi>Calvin</hi> foully to contradict himſelf. For as was proved before, <hi>Calvin</hi> in the ſame Book,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>fol.</hi> 210.</note> and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. lays down the right order of things exactly, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>the Lord Chriſt firſt declares, that the Treaſures of Gods Mercy are in him ſet open to us, which Declaration of his calls for the faith of aſſent in us. After that in the ſecond place, the Lord requires us to repent, induced thereunto by the faith of the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly, (Exigit fiduciam erga Dei promiſſiones;) He requires our truſt in the promiſes of God to us; now truly repenting of our ſins.</hi> The Act of Faith then which <hi>Calvin</hi> held to be in order before Repentance, and to be the root and ſpring of it; is the Faith of the conditional Promiſe of God, that he hath Mercy and Pardon for us, if we truly repent. And this ſeems to be his meaning by what he writes in the ſecond Paragraph following, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whilſt Chriſt and</hi> John <hi>preach thus, Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand: Do not they derive the cauſe of Repentance from the very Grace and Promiſe of Salvation? Therefore the import of their Words is as much, as if they had ſaid, becauſe the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand, therefore repent.</hi> And a little after he adds, (<hi>Quod etiam demonſtrat illa</hi> Oſeae <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Which thing alſo that exhortation of</hi> Hoſea <hi>demonſtrates, Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.1.</note> and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up: (Quia ſpes veniae tanquam ſtimulus additur, ne in ſuis peccatis torpeant:) Becauſe the hope of pardon is given as a ſpur (to Repentance,) leaſt they ſhould lie ſecure in their ſins.</hi> By this Paſſage we ſee, that the Faith which goes before Repentance, in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, is not the Faith that our ſins are already pardoned, but that they ſhall be pardoned upon our ſincere Repentance; which Faith puts us upon acting Repentance, and having put forth an Act of ſincere Repentance, we immediately act Faith upon the promiſe, and apply it to our ſelves, and truſt in the Lord, according to his gracious promiſe. If this be not <hi>Calvin</hi>'s ſenſe, let them free him from ſelf-contradiction that can, for we cannot otherwiſe do it. However it be, we have him expreſly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that Faith <hi>(in ſome ſenſe)</hi> is before Repentance, and that Repentance, (ſuch Repentance as that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23.) is before Remiſſion of Sins and Juſtification: From whence it follows neceſſarily, that in his Judgment, both ſincere Faith and Repentance are in order before Juſtification, and ſo that there is a real change and ſome holy principle and diſpoſition wrought in the Soul before Juſtification. The ſame he affirms again elſewhere, for thus he writes on <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12. — <hi>leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi> (<hi>Caeterùm ex eo minimè colligi debet, poenitentiam eſſe veniae cauſam,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>But from this it ought by no means to be inferred, that Repentance is the cauſe of pardon, as if God received into favour thoſe who are converted, becauſe they have merited or deſerved it: (For even Converſion it ſelf is a ſign of God's free Grace and Favour,) but only (ordo &amp; conſequentia notatur) the order and conſequence of things is marked out, becauſe God doth not forgive any ſins but thoſe for which Men are diſpleaſed with themſelves.</hi> From which Words of <hi>Calvin</hi> we obſerve, that where there is an order and conſequence of things, there is a priority and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriority,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93177:70"/>and one of them is before another; but ſo it is, that in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s opinion, between Repentance and pardon of ſin, there is an order, and the one is conſequent upon the other, pardon of ſin is conſequent upon Repentance, therefore Repentance is before pardon of ſin, but Repentance can never be without ſome real holy change and diſpoſition in the Penitent. Therefore there is ſuch a change and holy diſpoſition before Pardon and Juſtification. Again on <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord. <hi>(Eadem (inquit) vox auribus noſtris quotidie inſonat, ut Domino paremus viam, hoc eſt, ſublatis vitiis quae regno Chriſti viam praecludunt acceſſum demus ejus gratiae.) The ſame voice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dayly ſounds in our ears, that we ſhould prepare the way for the Lord, that is, that we ſhould give acceſs unto his grace, by putting away our ſins, which ſtop up the way againſt the reign of Chriſt in us.</hi> Theſe Words plainly give us to underſtand, that according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> Repentance and turning from ſin goes in order before pardon, and that it prepares us for the grace of Pardon and Juſtification. There needs no more to ſhew that <hi>Calvin</hi> held true Repentance, as to the beginning of it, to be in order before pardon of ſin and Juſtification. Yet when Repentance is taken for a courſe of holy living, in the actual performance of our firſt purpoſe to forſake our ſins, and return unto the Lord, then in that ſenſe it is confeſſed, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> and we with him hold Repentance to be after the ſeveral acts of Juſtifying Faith, and after Juſtification it ſelf, and that it runs parallel with our Lives, and muſt be continued unto Death. This was that which our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers called the beſt Repentance, which ſo enraged the Papiſts, that in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> they Anathematized us for this Opinion: <hi>Si quis dixerit — optimam poenitentiam eſſe tantùm novam vitam,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Can.</hi> 13.</note> Anathema ſit. If any ſhall ſay, that a new life is onely the beſt Repentance, let him be accurſed.</hi> Thus they. But we do not at all fear their Curſe, for notwithſtanding it, or any other thing to the contrary, we firmly believe, and ſay, that <hi>a new life is the onely beſt Repentance.</hi> And this beſt Repentance, this Repentance in its perfection we grant to be not only after juſtifying faith, but alſo to be after Juſtification it ſelf, and after the forgiveneſs of all the ſins that we had been guilty of before our Regeneration and Converſion; yet for all that, we ſtill maintain according to the Scriptures of Truth, that the beginning of true Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Repentance is in order before forgiveneſs of ſins, and juſtification; and we think we have <hi>Calvin</hi> on our ſide, if we may believe his own words.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Calvin</hi> ſucceeds <hi>Beza</hi> giving in his Teſtimony plainly for us, and ſaying in his large Confeſſion of faith, (<hi>Sed neceſſe eſt imprimis ut idem ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſanctus nos ad Jeſum Chriſtum recipiendum aptos &amp; idoneos reddat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">cap. 4. art. 3.</note> &amp;c.) <hi>But it is neceſſary</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the firſt place, that the ſame holy Spirit make us apt or fit and meet to receive Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his ſhort Confeſſion of faith, Art. 11th. <hi>As it was not (ſaith he) in our power to invent or find out the Medicine of Salvation, ſo neither is it poſſible for us to find out the way to uſe that Medicine rightly: Becauſe that falls out in this matter, which uſeth to be in bodily Diſeaſes; for as when one deſperately ſick is ignorant of his Diſeaſe, it is neceſſary that the Phyſician not only find out a Medicine for him, but likewiſe that he ſo diſpoſe the ſick Perſon that he may be both willing and able to uſe the Medicine, and that he may know the way to uſe it aright, ſo in the Diſeaſe of the Soul, which is the moſt dangerous of all, and in which Men are not only ignorant of, but alſo Adverſaries to their Salvation: It is neceſſary that we underſtand from the ſame Phyſician: Firſt, What that Medicine is, then which way it is to be uſed: Finally, That by the ſame Phyſician we be made fit and meet for this that we may be both willing and able to uſe the Remedies propoſed.</hi> Again, Art. 19. <hi>This Remedy (of free Salvation through Chriſt) is applyed by a double efficacy of the Holy Spirit: For firſt, The Holy Spirit diſpoſes or fits our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to perceive the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which otherwiſe ſeems meer fooliſhneſs to the World. Then he perſwades our minds that that Doctrine of free Salvation through
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93177:70"/>Chriſt, is not only true, but alſo that it pertains to us. And that is it which we call Faith ſo much commended in Scripture, to wit, when one perſwades himſelf aſſuredly that the promiſes of Salvation and Eternal Life particularly and properly belong to him.</hi> By theſe paſſages of <hi>Beza</hi> we ſee that he held as we do, that before a Man do, or can actually believe with a juſtifying Faith, he is diſpoſed, fitted and prepared by Chriſts Holy Spirit, for the right performing of that great work of believing aright. And in his little Book of Chriſtian Queſtions and Anſwers, <hi>To the Queſtion how we can be truly ſaid to have all gifts from Chriſt received by Faith, ſince if Chriſt be apprehended or received by Faith,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bez. lib. quaeſt. &amp; Reſp.</hi> p. 1. 149. 49. pag. edit. 1587.</note> then Faith it ſelf muſt go before that apprehenſion or reception.</hi> He Anſwers, If thou conſider the order of cauſes, I confeſs that the principle or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Faith (and that alſo true Faith) goes before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Chriſt, and therefore that it is not given to them who are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted, but who are to be ingrafted. By this paſſage we ſee likewiſe that <hi>Beza</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought that all ſaving Grace flows into us, from Chriſt already united to us, But that before Union he gives us ſaving Grace by his Spirit, whereby we may be united to him. Chriſt by his Spirit firſt apprehends and takes hold of us, and ſits us for, and brings us into actual Union with himſelf, and this Grace is in the order of cauſes before the Union on our part, and ſo is before our Juſtification. If our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had underſtood and conſidered all this that we have quoted out of <hi>Beza,</hi> he would never have thought it impoſſible that we can have any true Grace, any Holy Diſpoſition or Qualification before we be in Chriſt, and juſtified by Faith in him. For it is plain that we have the Grace from Chriſt, whereby we come to be in Chriſt, and Chriſt to be in us. And if it were not ſo, it would be impoſſible for us ever to be actually in Chriſt at all, or to be juſtified by Faith in him.</p>
               <p>Our Third Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Chriſto gratis juſtificante. Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it be an undoubted Truth, That Faith in Chriſt, the moſt high Son of God,
<note place="margin">page 307.</note> alone without works hath the Vertue and Power of juſtifying, as appears from the moſt clear words of</hi> Paul, <hi>and the Examples of Saints, but yet it doth not put forth this its juſtifying Vertue and Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, (praeterquàm in eos quos idoneos ſolùm invenit ſuſcipiendae Divinae gratiae,) but only upon thoſe whom it finds fitted or qualified for receiving the Divine Grace or Favour of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:)</hi> And that is, <hi>the humble and Penitent,</hi> as he ſhews in the following Section: Where towards the end of it, in <hi>page</hi> 310, he ſays, <hi>(Praeparat qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tem poenitentia ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam ad ſuſcipiendam Juſtificationem, &amp;c.) Repentance indeed prepares the matter for the receiving the Grace of Juſtification.</hi> (That is, it prepares the Soul for receiving Juſtification not as an inherent form in the Popiſh Senſe, but as a rich Priviledge and Favour beſtowed upon thoſe who are diſpoſed and qualified for it by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.) And that it is not only a Legal, but an Evangelical Repentance, which he ſpeaks of, is evident from what he ſaith at large in that Section, and eſpecially from the Teſtimonies of Scripture, which he brings to prove it: Such as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
               <p>Our Fourth Witneſs is <hi>Rollok</hi> whom we made uſe of before, and to whom <hi>Bodius</hi> his Scholar in his Commentary on the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> p. 1081, gives this Teſtimony, That <hi>he was a Man (quo nemo noſtra aetate Chriſtum Jeſum vel penitiùs imbiberat, vel aliorum animis efficacius inſtillabat) Then whom none in our Age either had drunk in Chriſt Jeſus more deeply or thoroughly into his own heart, or more Powerfully conveyed him into the hearts and Souls of others.</hi> This Holy and Orthodox Miniſter of Chriſt in his Book of Effectual Calling ſaith,
<note place="margin">page 3, 4.</note> That in effectual Calling conſidered as it is internal (<hi>Duplex eſt Dei Gratia, ſive operatio in cordibus noſtris,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There is a two-fold Grace of God, or operation in our hearts. The firſt Grace is, whilſt God by his Holy Spirit creates a new and heavenly light in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93177:71"/>mind, before involved in darkneſs, which neither ſaw, nor could ſee the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>In the Will wholly perverted and turned away from God, he creates a rectitude, and laſtly, a new Sanctity in all the Affections. Out of this Creation there exiſts or ariſeth that which is called the new Creature, that which is called the new Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Grace, or the ſecond Operation of the Spirit— is the act of Faith it ſelf, or an action proceeding from the new Creature,
<note place="margin">page 5.</note> the action of the enlightned mind in knowing God in Chriſt; the action of the ſanctified Will in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing or apprehending God in Chriſt, Here the principal Agent is the Spirit of God himſelf,— the ſecondary Agent is the Humane Soul it ſelf, or rather the new Man, and the new Creature it ſelf in the Soul, and its faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this ſecond Grace, which is the action or work of Faith, we are not now meerly paſſive,
<note place="margin">page 6.</note> but being acted by the Holy Spirit, we act, being excited to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we believe. In one word, with the Holy Spirit operating, we cooperate, and are workers together with the Holy Spirit.</hi> Now he cap. 34. p. 258. tells us afterwards in the ſame Book, that all this, and more than this, even the Holy Change that is wrought in the Soul by a true Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is before Juſtification. For (ſaith he) <hi>Repentance belongs to the place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Effectual Calling— Repentance goes before Juſtification, as Faith and Hope go before it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which we obſerve, that in the judgment of <hi>Rollock</hi> there is a real change made in the Soul before it be juſtified, and that it is prepared for Juſtification by God's working in it an Holy Principle or diſpoſition whereby it is inclined and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to produce the act of Faith, whereby it receives Chriſt, that for his ſake, and through his Righteouſneſs it may be juſtified.</p>
               <p>We might bring Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> for our Fifth and Sixth Witneſſes, for they are of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Rollock</hi> as to this matter, ſave that <hi>Rollock</hi> took the Word Regeneration to ſignifie the ſame thing with Sanctification, which comes after Effectual Calling and Juſtification; whereas they took Effectual Calling and Regeneration to be two words, which ſignifie the ſame thing, to wit, the firſt ſaving change which is wrought in the Soul, when a new Seminal Principle of Spiritual Life is put into it, and it is brought off from Sin and the World, unto Chriſt, and unto God through Chriſt, that it may be juſtified by Faith in his Blood. This appears to have been their Judgment by what we have already quoted out of them upon the former head. Let but any that can read in <hi>Ames his Marrow of Divinity,</hi> the Twenty Sixth Chapter of the firſt Book, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Vocation;</hi> as likewiſe the Tenth Chapter of his Reply to <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Nature of Faith, where he proves, That <hi>God by his Spirit puts a Seminal permanent Principle of Grace into the Soul at its firſt Converſion, and that before any act of ſaving Faith, and conſequently before Juſtification;</hi> We ſay, Let but any Man read thoſe Two Chapters of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his Books now mentioned, and he will ſee it as clear as the Sun, that he was of the ſame mind with <hi>Rollock,</hi> and held, <hi>That an Holy Change is wrought on us, and a Seed or Principle of Holyneſs is put into us, and ſome Holy Act is produced by us before we be juſtified, and our ſins be forgiven us.</hi>

                  </note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> anſwered, by Confeſſing ingenuouſly, <hi>That the places of Holy Scripture, which prove that Repentance is before Remiſſion of Sins, are</hi> (&amp; expreſſiora &amp; frequentiora) <hi>both more expreſs and more numerous; than thoſe that ſeem to favour the other Opinion.</hi> And indeed the places of Scripture, that ſpeak of Peoples repenting after their Sins are pardoned, prove nothing at all, but what we and all ſober Chriſtians grant, that our Repentance is to be continued all the days of our Life; and that the Repentance which is begun before Juſtification, and is but weak and imperfect, is to be carried on through Grace unto greater Perfection afterwards, by reducing our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes into Practice, and bringing forth Fruits meet for Repentance; to the doing whereof the Aſſurance of Gods ſpecial Love to us in having pardoned our Sins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted us as righteous unto Life through Jeſus Chriſt, doth not a little animate and excite us. As to what <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſaith there, that it is without Controverſie, that as Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins is an immanent Act in God, it is before both Faith and Repentance; that is, neither more nor leſs than this, that God himſelf and his Decree to remit Sin, is before both Faith and Repentance; which is indeed very true, for God and his Decree was before this World, or any thing in this World: but though it be true, it is nothing to the purpoſe; for to ſpeak properly as we ought, and as the Lord ſpeaks to us in his Word, <hi>Remiſſion of Sins, is not an immanent Act of God;</hi> that is, it is not the <hi>Decree</hi> of God which is <hi>Eternal,</hi> but the <hi>conſequent</hi> and the <hi>effect</hi> of the Decree, which is <hi>Temporal,</hi> and is every where promiſed in the Scripture, as a thing <hi>future</hi> and to come upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, and Repentance; as Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> himſelf expreſly affirms moſt frequently over and over, as we have ſhewed already, and may do it yet farther hereafter. From ſingle Witneſſes, we paſs to a whole Aſſembly of Divines, who give in their Teſtimony for us, and it is <hi>the Synod of</hi> Dort, the moſt famous Aſſembly of Divines, that ever was in the Reformed Churches; for it conſiſted of a great number of Learned men, dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and deputed from all <hi>the beſt Reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <q>But when God executes this his good Pleaſure in the Elect, or works in them true Converſion, he not only cauſeth the Goſpel to be outwardly Preached to them, and by the Holy Spirit powerfully enlightens their Mind, that they may rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and diſcern the things of the Spirit of God; but alſo by the Efficacy of the ſame regenerating Spirit, he penetrates or pierces into the innermoſt parts of Man, he opens his cloſed, he ſoftens his hard, and circumciſes his uncircumciſed Heart; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes new qualities into his Will, and of dead makes it alive, of evil makes it good, of unwilling makes it willing, of diſobedient makes it obedient, and ſo Acts and ſtrengthens it, that as a good Tree, it may be able to bring forth the Fruit of good Actions. — And then the Will now renewed, is not only acted and moved by God, but being acted by God, it acts it ſelf. Wherefore even Man himſelf by that Grace received, is rightly ſaid to believe and repent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſubſcribed by the whole Synod, now here we have ſuch a Teſtimony of the Reformed Churches for <hi>a real change,</hi> for <hi>Holy Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> in the Soul of Man <hi>before Juſtification;</hi> as we are ſure our Author can never find the like to oppoſe againſt us, for no real change, no Holy Qualifications or Diſpoſitions in the Soul of Man before ſuſtification. And that the Synod held this real change, thoſe Holy Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93177:72"/>or Diſpoſitions to be in the Soul <hi>before Juſtification,</hi> is manifeſt, becauſe they affirm all this to be neceſſary that the Will may be able to act, and that the Man may produce <hi>the ſaving Acts of Faith and Repentance;</hi> but ſo it is, that the very Act it ſelf of Faith is <hi>before</hi> Juſtification as hath been proved, and ſo it was believed to be by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodic Therefore <hi>a fortiori,</hi> all that is before the Act of Faith, is alſo before Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This were enough, if we could ſay no more, to prove that it is we who cleave to the old received Proteſtant Doctrine in this matter.

Their Words are,

Yet our God is infinitely Wiſe, and brings Light out of his Darkneſs, for by this we come to underſtand by the Teſtimony of <hi>Bradwardin</hi> (who we Hope may be believed in a matter of Fact) that it was a piece of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> to hold that we are juſtified, and our Sins pardoned, <hi>before</hi> there be a real change made in us; and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſpoſitions or Qualifications wrought in our Souls by Chriſts Holy Spirit. And if any Body ſhould Queſtion the Truth of <hi>Bradwardins</hi> Teſtimony, concerning <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Opinion about Juſtification, we can prove the ſame matter of Fact, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a better Witneſs; and that is the famous <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was Contemporary with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and wrote againſt his Opinions at their firſt appearance in the World.</p>
               <p>The other Secret which we have to tell <hi>our Authour,</hi> is, that it is <hi>a Popiſh Opinion</hi> to aſſert that there is no Gracious Principle infuſed, no Holy Diſpoſition or Qualification wrought in us by Gods Spirit, before the Remiſſion of our Sins.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:93177:74"/>
               <p>Of this Opinion was <hi>Jacobus Almainus</hi> a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> who lived in the 15th Century a little before the Reformation, as appears by what he writes in his Book of Morality.
<note place="margin">Lib. Moral. Tract. de cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate.</note> (<hi>Iſta rationalis, eſt vera, quia Deus acceptat ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem ad vitam aeternam, dat illi Charitatem, &amp; non è diverſo: nam iſta eſt falſa, quia dat Charitatem, acceptat ad vitam aeternam, ergo prius naturâ acceptat ad vitam aeternam, quam det Charitatem infuſam.) This way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is true, becauſe God accepts a man unto Eternal Life, therefore he gives him Love, or infuſes into him a Principle of Grace; but not on the contrary for this is falſe, that becauſe God gives him Love, or infuſes into him a Principle of Grace, therefore he accepts him unto Eternal Life, and therefore God doth firſt in Order of Nature accept a man unto Eternal Life, before he give him infuſed Charity.</hi> Thus <hi>Almain,</hi> whereupon we obſerve, that he held Juſtification taken in the Proteſtant Senſe, to be before any real Holy change be made in the Soul, by infuſed Grace in Regeneration and Effectual Calling. For (1.) By Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance unto Eternal Life, he meant that we call by the Name of Juſtification. (2.) By Gods giving infuſed Love, he meant that which we call Regeneration and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling, or the Holy change that is thereby begun in the Soul. But ſo it is, that he held Acceptance unto Eternal Life, to be before the Gift of infuſed Love, or infuſed Grace, which they call by the Name of Love; therefore he held Juſtification to be in Order before Effectual Calling, or any Holy Principle put into, or change wrought in the Soul thereby.</p>
               <p>And the Popiſh Biſhops of <hi>Walemburgh</hi> are yet more clearly for this, for thus they write,

And the People may if they pleaſe, go on to drink in that <hi>Pelagian, Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Arminian Doctrine,</hi> taking it upon our Authors Word to be a part of the pure Chriſtian Religion, and of the Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by free Grace without good Works and Holy Qualifications, or any thing that looks like them.</p>
               <p>But for our parts we declare, that we are for the Doctrine of <hi>the Synod of</hi> Dort, in the Point of a real Holy Change, and Holy Qualifications before Juſtification, and cannot but prefer it before that <hi>Pelagian</hi> Opinion, which ſome People are ſo fond of; and they muſt not expect that ever we will humour them in that matter, unleſs our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour will ſolidly anſwen our Arguments, and give us better Arguments for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than we have here given for ours. As for what he ſaith to that purpoſe in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we can therein find nothing of any weight; as r. in Page 9. <hi>We ſay not</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that there is an actual partaking of Chriſts fulneſs of Grace, till we be in him by Faith, though this Faith is alſo given us on Chriſts behalf,</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>And we believe through Grace,</hi> Acts 18.27. Thus he Argues to prove, that all the Grace we receive from Chriſt, comes from our being united to him by Faith, and ſo that we cannot actually partake of the Grace of Chriſt <hi>before</hi> our Union with Chriſt by Faith. Now if this be ſo, we demand of him concerning this being in Chriſt by Faith, or (which is the ſame thing) <hi>this union with Chriſt by Faith,</hi> either it is effected by the Grace of Chriſt, or without the Grace of Chriſt, by the meer Power of Nature? Not the <hi>Second,</hi> to wit, without the Grace of Chriſt, by the meer Power of Nature. For (1.) That is rank <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> or <hi>Semipelagianiſm</hi> at leaſt. (2.) It is contrary to what he ſays in the ſame place, that the Faith by which we come to be in Chriſt is given us on Chriſts behalf, and that we believe through Grace. The <hi>First</hi> then is that, which he doth and muſt chooſe to ſay, to wit, that our Union with Chriſt by Faith is effected by the Grace of Chriſt: And then it is ſelf-evident. that that <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt which <hi>Effects Faith</hi> in us and the Union with Chriſt by Faith, is <hi>before Faith</hi> and the Union by Faith, becauſe <hi>the Cauſe</hi> always is and muſt be in Order of Nature <hi>before the Effect.</hi> And further, if the Grace of Chriſt by which we believe firſt in him and are united to him, be before that Faith and Union by Faith, then <hi>we receive that Grace</hi> from Chriſt <hi>before</hi> we be in Chriſt by Faith, and we receive it <hi>to this end,</hi> that our faculties may be fitted and prepared, yea and powerfully helped actually to believe, and by believing to be actually united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; thus our Author is caught in a Net of his own making, he blows hot and cold out of the ſame Mouth, and contradicts himſelf moſt foully in ſaying, that we do not actually partake of Chriſts fulneſs till we be in him by Faith, and yet that we have that Faith, and Union by Faith, from the Grace of Chriſt as the cauſe thereof; for certainly that Grace is a part of Chriſts fulneſs, and if he give it us and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from him for the producing of Faith and Union with him by Faith, then we actually partake of his fulneſs before we be in him by Faith.</p>
               <p>That People therefore may no more be puzzled with ſuch ſelf-confounding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93177:75"/>Stuff, we deſire them to conſider, (1.) That all our Supernatural Grace is from Chriſt by his Spirit, this we are all agreed in. (2.) That yet all Supernatural Grace is not from Chriſt <hi>after the ſame Way and Manner,</hi> for there is ſome Grace from Chriſt <hi>before</hi> Union, and in Order to Union, and ſome Grace is from Chriſt united, from Chriſt now <hi>in actual Union</hi> with our Souls by Faith; of the <hi>first</hi> ſort, is the firſt preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace, the Grace by which we are Effectually Called; the Grace by which we are diſpoſed and prepared to believe; and by which we do actually believe, and by ſo believing anſwer the Call, receive Chriſt into our Hearts, and come to be actually united unto him. This Grace being the cauſe of Faith, and of the Union by Faith, is before Union with Chriſt, and ſo cannot poſſibly be from Chriſt conſidered as united to us by Faith. Though then all our Grace be from Chriſt, yet it is notoriouſly falſe, that it is all from him as ours already by Faith; for preventing Grace which is before Faith, is not drawn from Chriſt by Faith; as alſo Faith it ſelf, we mean the firſt Principle and firſt Act of Faith, is not drawn from Chriſt as already ours by Faith, for then Faith would be both before and after it ſelf, which is contradictious non-ſenſe, and impoſſible. Of <hi>the Second ſort,</hi> is all ſubſequent Grace, the Grace of Juſtification, of Progreſſive Sanctification and Perſeverance, yea all that Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods Select People (being once called according to his Purpoſe) are fitted for, and brought unto Glory, is from Chriſt united, from Chriſt in actual Union with our Souls by Faith. <hi>Augustin</hi> writing againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> above 12 hundred years ago,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Angust. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> 105.</note> hath cleared up this matter in few Words, writing thus to <hi>Sixtus, [Ita ſine Spiritu ſidei, non est rectê quiſpiam crediturus, nec ſine ſpiritu orationis ſalubriter oraturus; non quia tot ſint ſpiritus ſed omnia haec operatur unus atque idem ſpiritus, dividens propria unicuique prout vult: quia Spiritus ubi vult, ſpirat. ſed quod fatendum est, aliter adjuvat nondum inhabitans, aliter inhabitans, — nam nondum inhabitans adjuvat ut ſint fideles; inhabitans adjuvat jam fideles.</hi>] That is, <hi>So without the Spirit of Faith, no man will ever believe aright, nor without the Spirit of Prayer, will any man ever pray in a ſaving manner; not that there are ſo many Spirits, but one and the ſame Spirit doth all theſe things, dividing unto every man that which is proper to him, as he will, for the Spirit breaths where he will. But it muſt be confeſſed that the Spirit doth otherwiſe help before he doth inhabit, and otherwiſe when he doth inhabit in the Soul; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be come to inhabit in the Soul, he helps men that they may be Believers; but when he doth inhabit and dwell in the Soul, he helps them who are Believers.</hi> This one Diſtinction of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> attended unto, would help People to underſtand this matter, and to anſwer all that our Authour ſaith againſt any real change, or Holy Seed, Diſpoſition or Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wrought in the Soul before it be juſtified. For our Bleſſed Lord by his Holy Spirit, firſt prepares and qualifies, and makes us meet to be an Habitation for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and then he comes unto us by the ſame Spirit, and dwells in us and abides with us for ever, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.22. and 3.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. Now the firſt of theſe, is in Order before Juſtification. God by his Spirit and Word, firſt makes us ſuch as his Word requires us to be, that we may be juſtified; he ſavingly enlightens our Minds, and enlivens our Hearts, he gives us a Seed of Faith, and a Holy Principle of Light, Liſe and Love, and by an influence of actual Grace, cauſes us freely to reduce the ſaid Seed and Principle into Act, and ſo actually to believe and repent; which when we do through Grace, then he juſtifies us on the account of <hi>Chriſts ſatisfactory meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Righteouſneſs</hi> imputed to us. And after that we are effectually Called, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are become Penitent Believers, and are juſtified and reconciled; the Lord gives us his Spirit, and by his Spirit he comes and dwells in us, he ſtrengthens and encreaſes the Grace that he had begun in us, and makes us more and more Holy in Heart and Life. This is that which is commonly called Sanctification, and follows after Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and through Chriſts dwelling in us by his Spirit, is carried on from one decree to another, till it have attained its gradual Perfection, and be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in Glory.

                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 11.</note> But he objects, (2.) <hi>Shall we tell Men, that unleſ they be Holy, they must not believe on Jeſus Chriſt; nor venture on him for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93177:75"/>till they be qualified, and fit to be received by him. This were to forbear Preaching the Goſpel at all, or to forbid all Men to believe on Chriſt; for never was any Sinner qualified for Chriſt, nor is it poſſible that ever any Sinner ſhould be qualified for Chriſt.</hi> We Anſwer our Author had ſaid a little before in the ſame Page, <hi>That every one who Believes on Chriſt, acts that Faith as the chief of Sinners,</hi> that is, believes as an unbeliever, as was before proved to be his meaning by his own expreſs Words, if his Words be expreſſive of his Mind. And now by the Queſtion, which he puts to us here, he ſeems plainly to be of Opinion, that every man <hi>muſt</hi> believe as an unbeliever, or elſe <hi>no man can</hi> ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at all; and Miniſters <hi>muſt</hi> give over Preaching the Goſpel, for they can never preach it as it ſhould be preached, unleſs they tell People that they <hi>muſt</hi> Act their Faith as the chief of Sinners, that is, they muſt believe as unbelievers; for either we muſt tell People that they muſt believe as Unbelievers, or elſe that they muſt not believe till they be firſt Holy, and that is, that they muſt never believe at all, becauſe it is impoſſible for them to be Holy, till after they have believed in Chriſt and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him by Faith. This is plainly the ſenſe of our Authors Words, and the force of his Reaſoning; which puts us in mind of what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays out of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> (<hi>de bono perſeverantiae,</hi> Cap. 22.)
<note place="margin">Calv. <hi>Inſtit.</hi> lib. 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. § 14.</note> that there are (<hi>inſulſi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores gratiae) ſome fooliſh Preachers of Grace,</hi> and ſurely (if any) they are to be accounted ſuch Preachers, who in effect tell People that they muſt believe as unbelievers, or elſe they muſt not believe till they be firſt Holy, and that is, they muſt never believe at all. But is there no way to avoid this fooliſh ſenſeleſs way of Preaching? <hi>Our Author</hi> thinks there is not, we on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are perſwaded, that there is a way to avoid it; and in our Judgment it may thus be eaſily done; we tell People that they muſt believe in Chriſt not as Unholy Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor yet as Holy with that Holineſs which is the effect of Believing and follows after Faith in Chriſt; but by ceaſing to be Unholy Unbelievers, and by becoming Holy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and if they ask us how this can poſſibly be done? we anſwer, Not by Power of Nature, but by the Power of Gods ſpecial Grace? if they ask further, How they can obtain that ſpecial Grace before they believe and be in Chriſt by Faith, ſince all Grace is derived from Chriſt by Faith? we anſwer, that all Grace indeed is derived <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> but it is a moſt notorious falſhood, that all Grace is derived from Chriſt <hi>by Faith;</hi> for the firſt ſpecial Grace which is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, is not from Chriſt by Faith, but it is from Chriſt <hi>before</hi> Faith; and it is given us by the Holy Spirit of Chriſt to work Faith in us, and to bring us into Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt by Faith; if they ſay that even according to this way, People muſt ſtill believe before they are Holy, and ſo muſt believe as not being yet Holy. We anſwer, that is true in one reſpect and falſe in another. It is true that People muſt believe before they are Holy with that Progreſſive Holineſs, which is the <hi>effect</hi> of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, and follows <hi>after</hi> Juſtification; but it is utterly falſe, that People do believe or can believe <hi>ſavingly before</hi> they are <hi>Initially Holy,</hi> before they are Holy with that firſt beginning and Principle of Holineſs, which conſiſts in removing the ill Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Faculties, and in giving our Faculties a right ſpiritual Supernatural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and fitneſs for the Act of Believing; this Holy Principle concurs to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the Act of Faith, and ſo muſt be in Order before it, and then the Act it ſelf of Faith, which is an Holy Act, muſt be in order <hi>before</hi> Juſtification: Therefore it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe, that there can be no Holineſs at all, in any kind or degree before Faith and Juſtification by Faith, ſince before actual Faith, there is the Holy Seed and Principle both of Faith and Repentance and of other Graces too, and in order of Nature there is an Holy actual Faith before Juſtification; and this is a Truth ſo clear that <hi>our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> himſelf ſometimes could ſee it, as <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. <hi>Where he ſays that no man can do any thing that is good, till Goſpel Grace renew him, and make him firſt a good man;</hi> this is very true, if it be rightly underſtood, <hi>thus,</hi> No man can do any thing that is ſpiritually, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and ſavingly good, till Goſpel Grace, that is, internal ſpecial Grace renew him and make him firſt a good man, that is, a good man <hi>initially,</hi> or make him begin to be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93177:76"/>a good Man. But now this makes againſt our Author himſelf, and clearly proves that no Man can believe with a ſaving juſtifying Faith, till Goſpel Grace renew him and make him firſt a good Man: this Conſequence from his own Words he can never avoid, unleſs he will ſay that a ſaving juſtifying Faith is no good thing; for if it be not an evil but a good thing, no Man can do it till Goſpel Grace have renewed him, and make him firſt a good Man. So then we have found by his own Confeſſion that a Man is <hi>firſt good</hi> through Grace, and then he <hi>believes</hi> in Chriſt to Juſtification. And if a Man be thus good, <hi>initially</hi> good before he <hi>actually</hi> believe with a ſaving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, then is he <hi>Holy</hi> alſo, <hi>initially</hi> Holy before he do ſo believe, for that Initial Goodneſs, and this Initial Holineſs is one and the ſame thing. And further, if a man may be, and muſt be thus initially Good and Holy before he actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then he may be qualified before he actually believe; for he cannot be Good and Holy as aforeſaid, without Gods putting ſome good qualities into him. This the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> hath determined in their 11. Canon on the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles, as was ſhewed before, and it is hoped <hi>our Author</hi> will not oppoſe the Determination of that Synod.</p>
               <p>Now whenever God by his Spirit puts good qualities into a Man, he thereby qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies him; for the very <hi>formal effect</hi> of <hi>good qualities,</hi> is to <hi>qualifie the Man</hi> to whom God gives them.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 11.</note> But ſaith our Author, <hi>Whence ſhould a Man have any good Qualification before he be in Chriſt by Faith, ſince a Sinner out of Chriſt, hath no Qualification for Chriſt but Sin and Miſery.</hi> We Anſwer, that before a Man be <hi>in Chriſt</hi> by Faith, he hath ſome good Qualification <hi>from Christ by his Spirit</hi> preparing him for, and bringing him unto Union with himſelf by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faith.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſaith, that a Sinner out of Chriſt hath no Qualification for Chriſt but Sin and Miſery: We Anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing thus, he hath no Qualification but Sin and Miſery, <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from himſelf;</hi> It is true. But that he hath no Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of and from Chriſt</hi> by his Holy Spirit, but Sin and Miſery; it is utterly falſe, and the contrary is true, to wit, that a Man who hath no Qualification of and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the evil Qualification of Sin and Miſery, yet of and from Chriſt by his Spirit and Word, he hath the good Qualification of a Heart in part changed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and of a Holy Seed and Prineiple of Grace put into his Heart. Though a Man cannot qualifie himſelf for Chriſt; yet nothing hinders but that Chriſt by his Spirit and Word can qualifie a man for Union with himſelf, and for Juſtification by his Meritorious Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Yes ſaith our Author, ſomething doth hinder, for <hi>I boldly aſſert, that ſuch a man (who were ſo qualified) would not,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Let.</hi> p. 11.</note> nor could ever believe on Chriſt.</hi> We are not willing here to apply the Proverb, That <hi>none is ſo bold as blind</hi> Bayard. But this we muſt ſay, that we cannot ſee that this Man hath any probable ground for ſuch Confidence. Sure we are, it will be a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult task to prove that a man cannot poſſibly believe in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt by his Word and Spirit, hath fitted and qualified him for Believing. But it ſeems no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is difficult to this bold man, and therefore he will prove it by an Argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Nature of Faith; thus, <hi>Faith (ſaith he) is a loſt, helpleſs, condemned Sinners caſting himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation. But the qualified Man is no ſuch Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then the Concluſion, if rightly inferred from the Premiſſes, is this, <hi>ergo,</hi> The qualified Man is not Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A goodly Argument indeed, and a Foundation fit for this Man to ground his Confidence upon. If he ſay that his Argument doth not ſo conclude, but rather thus. Faith is a Gracious Act, whereby a loſt helpleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Sinner, caſts himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation; but the qualified Man is not a loſt helpleſs condemned Sinner, caſting himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation, therefore the qualified man is not (what is he not? why he is not?) a loſt helpleſs condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sinner caſting himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation. Is this now his Argument? And doth it thus conclude, then his Argument is as Ridiculous as his Confidence. Let
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93177:76"/>him keep to his Premiſſes laid down in his Letter, and if he can, let him regularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr from them another Concluſion than one of theſe.</p>
               <p>But let what will become of the form of his Argument. We anſwer by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing both Propoſitions. And (1.) For the <hi>firſt,</hi> we ſay, that a Perſon who by true Faith caſts himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation, is indeed a Sinnor, loſt and helpleſs in and of himſelf, and he is condemned by the Law; but tho that be true, yet in Order of Nature before he believes, and in the very Act of Believing, he is found and helped by the Lord, and hath a Pardon offered him by the Goſpel, and by Faith he receives it, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</p>
               <p>Then for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Propoſition, we diſtinguiſh it alſo thus. The qualified Man is not ſuch a Perſon; is not a loſt, helpleſs, condemned Sinner; that is, the Man that is, (1.) Qualified with a Satisfactory, Meritorious Qualification. (2.) That is, ſo qualified by himſelf, he is not ſuch a Perſon: It is true, and we grant it. But with all, we ſay that indeed it is impoſſible for any Man ſo to qualifie himſelf. Yet we maintain, that a Man who is qualified by the Holy Spirit, and free Effectual Grace of Chriſt, is ſuch a Perſon, and doth by Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſt himſelf on Chriſt for Salvation; our being qualified by the Holy Spirit and free Effectual Grace of Chriſt, is ſo far from hindring our believing (as <hi>our Author</hi> boldly, but <hi>ignorantly</hi> affirms) that in Truth it doth very much further our believing; it lets us ſee, and cauſes us to feel that we are loſt and helpleſs in and of our ſelves, and condemned by the Law, and that we are found and helped by the Lord, and can be pardoned only by the Goſpel. Whereupon it inclines and moves us, to flee unto Chriſt for refuge, and to caſt our ſelves on him for Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the ſame Page,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 11.</note> we have another of his Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, we have been proving by <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> of Proteſtant Divines. [<hi>Shall we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>warn People that they ſhould not believe on Chriſt too ſoon?</hi>] Either this Interrogation is altogether impertinent, or there is this Argument implied in it, if there be a real change, and a holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principle wrought in Peoples Hearts, before they do or can believe with a ſaving juſtifying Faith, then it will follow that Miniſters ſhould warn people not to believe on Chriſt <hi>too ſoon,</hi> but ſo to do is abſurd and contrary to Scripture. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by denying the Conſequence of the firſt Propoſition as falſe, for it doth not follow that we ſhould warn People not to believe on Chriſt too ſoon. And we have nothing Offered to prove that ſuch an abſurdity follows from our Doctrine, but this mans bare Word, which we have found to be ſo often falſe in matter of Fact, that we can give no credit to it in other things.</p>
               <p>And he is ſo unhappy here and elſewhere throughout his Letter, that he makes his own Tongue or Pen to fall upon himſelf; for he confeſſes that it is no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that if People cannot be truly Holy before the Tree be changed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33, 34, 35. and before they have a new Heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. (as he grants they cannot), then Miniſters ſhould warn People not to be Holy too ſoon. For to give them any ſuch warning he grants to be abſur'd.</p>
               <p>Let him then conſider,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 11, 12.</note> whether the ſame or the like Anſwer he can give to this Argument, which would prove that Miniſters ſhould warn People not to be <hi>Holy too ſoon,</hi> may not be given to the other ſilly Argument, whereby he would prove that upon our Principle Miniſters ſhould warn People not to <hi>believe on Chriſt too ſoon;</hi> for it is as certainly true, that People cannot actually believe on Chriſt with a ſaving juſtifying Faith, before the Tree be changed and the Heart be in part renewed; as it is that they cannot be truely Holy before the Tree be changed, and the Heart be renewed. When we are to deal with Unbelievers, our Lord hath given us other Work to do, than to warn them not to believe too ſoon; and let our Author try when he pleaſes, he will find enough to do, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that their preſent Indiſpoſition and diſability to believe, doth not free them from the Obligation, which the Lord by his Word hath laid upon them to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93177:77"/>believe; and to direct them unto the right means, in the uſe whereof they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Lord both the neceſſary Diſpoſition unto Faith, and alſo the Principle and Act of Faith it ſelf. Our Author we perceive has been at this Work, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have done with him, we ſhall ſee what a rare Specimen of his skill this way, he hath given the World.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But he farther Objects, <hi>We hold forth that God juſtifieth the Ungodly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 25.</note> Rom. 4.5. <hi>Neither by making him Godly before he juſtifie him, nor leaving him Ungodly after be hath juſtified him; but that the ſame Grace that justifies him, doth immediately ſanctifie him.</hi> We Anſwer, this is the Text that our <hi>Antinomians</hi> much inſiſt upon, and think it ſufficient to make all Men <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> And we are glad to find, that it hath not that full effect upon him, for tho he be one with them, with reſpect to any Holy change in Order before Juſtification, and denies it, as they do; yet he ſeparates himſelf from them with reſpect to what follows after Juſtification, and ſaith, that we are ſanctified immediately after Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſo he joins himſelf to us; now there may be good worldly Policy in this to hold with both ſides as much as he can.</p>
               <p>But if he do <hi>not agree with himſelf,</hi> what ground can others have to truſt him, that ever he will heartily agree with them; and that he doth not agree with himſelf, we think is apparent from what he writes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. <hi>A Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to believe that he may be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. Again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 32. <hi>No Words or Warnings repeated, nor plainest Instructions can beat into Mens Heads and Hearts, that the first coming to Christ by Faith, or Believing on him, is not a Believing we ſhall be ſaved by him, but a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, that we may be ſaved by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. <hi>The direct Act is properly justifying ſaving Faith, by which the loſt Sinner comes to Christ, and relies upon him for Salvation. Yet when we do preſs Sinners to come to Christ by a direct Act of Faith, conſisting in an humble reliance on him for Mercy and Pardon; they will understand us (whether we will or not) of a reflex Act of Faith, by which a Man knows and believes that his Sins are pardoned, and that Christ is his: when they might eaſily know that we mean no ſuch thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three Paſſages, ſhow clearly that he holds ſaving Faith to be both before Juſtification, and before Aſſurance of Juſtification. We confeſs that we do very well underſtand this to be the meaning of theſe Words now quoted ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for we think they are not capable of any other ſenſe; but though we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Words of the Letter, yet we do not underſtand <hi>the Author</hi> of them, and we much doubt whether he underſtands himſelf; and that becauſe he immediately adds,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>that Mr.</hi> Marſhal <hi>in his excellent Book lately Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, hath largely opened this, and the true Controverſie of this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. <hi>Marſhals Book</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a deep practical well jointed Diſcourſe, — and if it be ſingly uſed, I look upon it, as one of the most uſeful Books the World hath ſeen for many Years. I fear not, but it will stand firm as a Rock against all Oppoſition and will prove good Seed, and Food, and Light, and Life to many hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who that reads this can doubt, but that <hi>our Author</hi> has read <hi>Marſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> Book, and that he approves it, and believes every thing at leaſt, that is material in it; and yet there is one thing very material in it, and it is one of the main <hi>joints</hi> in it, <hi>That justifying Faith is a Believing, that we are now justified and ſhall be Eternally ſaved; and that the Aſſurance of this, that we are now juſtified and ſhall be ſaved, is eſſential to the direct Act of Faith.</hi> This <hi>Marſhal</hi> with all his might ſtrives to prove, and it ſeems he hath done it to the Conviction of <hi>our Author,</hi> who believes that, that Opinion can never be diſproved again. Yea he ſeems ſo Confident of the Truth of <hi>Marſhals</hi> Opinion, that he ſpares not to reflect on the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly of Divines</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, as they do in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Chap. 18. Art. 3. In theſe Words. <hi>This infallible Aſſurance doth not ſo belong to the Eſſence of Faith, but that a true Believer may mait long, and conflict with many difficulties, before he be partaker of it:</hi> Thus the Aſſombly. But doth he reflect on them for this? why, if he doth not, let him tell
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93177:77"/>us what he means by theſe following Words, <hi>Was not the Holineſs of the firſt Proteſtants, eminent and ſhining?
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Let.</hi> p. 22.</note> and yet they generally put Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Definition of their Faith. We cannot ſay that Goſpel Holineſs has proſpered much by the Correction or Mitigation of that harſh-like Definition.</hi> If theſe Words of his (whatever might be his Intention) do not reflect upon the Aſſembly we do not underſtand plain Engliſh, and moreover we cannot but think alſo, that they imply his owning of <hi>Marſhals</hi> Definition of Faith, as <hi>not being really harſh,</hi> but only <hi>harſh-like,</hi> though he puts Aſſurance into it, as being eſſential to Faith in its direct Act.</p>
               <p>So that by comparing one Paſſage of his Letter with another, we find that he believes with <hi>Marſhal,</hi> That true Faith in Chriſt is a Believing at firſt, that <hi>we are juſtified:</hi> And he believes with us that, <hi>that is not true,</hi> but that <hi>it is a believing only</hi> at firſt, <hi>that we may be juſtified.</hi> Again, he believes with <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that juſtifying Faith in its <hi>firſt direct Act,</hi> is a Believing that we <hi>ſhall</hi> be aſſuredly ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And he believes with us, that juſtifying Faith in its firſt direct Act, <hi>is no ſuch thing, it is not</hi> a believing that we <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſaved by Chriſt, but it is a believing, that we <hi>may</hi> be ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Further, he believes with <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that Aſſurance that our Sins are forgiven, and that our Souls ſhall be ſaved, <hi>is eſſential to the first direct Act</hi> of juſtifying Faith. And he believes with us, that it is <hi>quite otherwiſe,</hi> and that we <hi>do not get</hi> ſuch Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by <hi>the firſt direct Act</hi> of Faith, but <hi>by its reftex Acts,</hi> which follow after the direct.</p>
               <p>And then for the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> he believes with them that <hi>before</hi> Juſtification there <hi>is no real change</hi> wrought in the Soul, from Ungodlineſs to Godlineſs, in any Kind or Degree, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>That God juſtifies the Ungodly.</hi> And yet he believes with us, that before Juſtification, <hi>there is a real change</hi> wrought in the Soul from Unbelief to Faith in Chriſt, becauſe the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>That we believe in Chriſt, that we may be juſtified.</hi> And he cannot deny, but that a real change from unbelief to Faith in Chriſt, is a change, and a real change too, from Ungodlineſs to Godlineſs in ſome kind or degree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he himſelf holds <hi>unbelief</hi> to be the chiefeſt part of <hi>Ungodlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt to be the chiefeſt part of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> witneſs his own Words, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Lord Jeſus for Salvation is more pleaſing to God, than all obedience to his Law, and that unbelief is the moſt provoking to God, and the most damning to Men of all Sins.</hi> If our Author believe this, then by neceſſary Conſequence he believes that unbelief is the chiefeſt part of ungodlineſs, and that Faith is the chiefeſt part of Godlineſs; and that a real change from unbelief to Faith in Chriſt, is a real change from Ungodlineſs to Godlineſs in ſome kind and degree. The import and iſſue of this, is, that <hi>our Author</hi> believes both parts of a Contradiction. With the <hi>Antinomians</hi> he believes that before Juſtification, <hi>there is no real change</hi> from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs to Godlineſs in any kind or degree. And with us he believes, that before Juſtification, <hi>there is a real change from the Ungodlineſs of unbelief, to the Godlineſs of Faith,</hi> becauſe the Sinner through Grace comes off from his Ungodly <hi>unbelief</hi> that he <hi>may</hi> believe, and he believes that he may be juſtified, and ſo in order of Nature before he be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Now ſince <hi>our Author</hi> is ſo ſtrong a Believer, that he can believe both parts of a Contradiction; why may not we think that, as he believes that <hi>we preach</hi> a new Pelagian, Arminian Goſpel, ſo he may believe at the ſame time that <hi>we do not preach</hi> a new Pelagian, Arminian Goſpel, but the old Everlaſting Goſpel of Chriſt. He believes <hi>in his Letter,</hi> that <hi>we do preach</hi> a new Goſpel, and for ought we know to the contrary, he may at the ſame time <hi>believe in his Conſcience,</hi> that <hi>we do not</hi> preach <hi>a new Goſpel;</hi> for his <hi>Letter</hi> and his <hi>Conſcience</hi> are two different things, that may not have much Communion one with another, yea in this matter they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93177:78"/>may be at Hoſtile Enmity, the <hi>Letter</hi> may be againſt his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and his <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> againſt the <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But will not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> juſtifie him in Believing Contradictions, ſince he ſays in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. That Men believe in Chriſt, that they may be juſtified, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that Faith is <hi>before</hi> Juſtification. But in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. He ſays, that God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies <hi>the Ungodly,</hi> and by that it ſeems that Faith is after Juſtification.</p>
               <p>We Anſwer, far be it from any that fear the Lord, to charge the Apoſtle with contradicting himſelf, or with giving any ground to believe Contradictions; for thus he writes to the <hi>Corimbians,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.18. <hi>As God is true, our Word toward you, was not Yea and Nay.</hi> That is, it did not contradict it ſelf. And as he did not contradict himſelf in Preaching and Writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> no more did he do it in Preaching and Writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> We muſt therefore ſo underſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. (of which the Queſtion now is) as not to make it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>And that is no difficult matter to do. For we may eaſily conceive, that this form of Speech <hi>(God juſtifieth the Ungodly)</hi> is like that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. <hi>The Deaf hear.</hi> Now no Man is ſo fooliſh as to think that the Deaf remaining Deaf, did firſt hear, and then immeditely after were cured of their Deaſneſs; why then ſhould we be ſo fooliſh, as to underſtand the Apoſtle as if he had ſaid, that God juſtifies men whileſt they remain ungodly without any real change wrought in them; and that immeditely after he hath juſtified them, he firſt begins to make them God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to ſanctifie them? We are perſwaded it is much more rational to underſtand the Apoſtle the quite contrary way, to wit, that as the Deaf were firſt in Order of Nature and Cauſality cured of their Deafneſs, and then they did actually hear; ſo God firſt Works a Holy change in the Heart of a Sinner, and of an ungodly unpenitent Unbeliever makes him a godly penitent Believer, and then immediately juſtifies him by Faith in Chriſt. So that the Sinner whom God juſtifies, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>(Antecedenter fed non Concomitanter)</hi> that is, he was ungodly in the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was juſtified, but he is not ungodly either in the inſtant of Nature before, or in the inſtant of Time when he is juſtified, but on the contrary he is, through Grace, Godly both before and when he is juſtified.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. We Anſwer, that the Man whom God juſtifies by Faith in Chriſt, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Godly <hi>Evangelically,</hi> both in Order of Nature before he be juſtified, and at the time when be is juſtified; and yet at the ſame time he may be ſaid to be <hi>legally</hi> ungodly: for underſtanding this, we are to conſider, that the Man whom God juſtifies, may be compared with and judged by the Law of Works, or the Law of Faith; if he be compared with and judged by the Law of Works, he is found to be in himſelf an Ungodly Man, becauſe he hath not perfectly kept, but hath frequently tranſgreſſed that Law, and ſo can never be juſtified but is condemned by it. But if he be compared with and judged by the Law of Faith, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Law, the Law of the New Covenant, he is found to be a Godly Man through Grace, to be Evangelically Godly; becauſe he is juſt ſuch a Man, as the Lord by the New Covenant and Evangelical Law requires him to be, that he may be firſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſts Righteouſneſs, imputed to him; that is, he is found to be a Man whom God hath bleſſed with a new Heart, and who is a <hi>true Penitent Believer,</hi> and that is, a Man <hi>Evangelically</hi> Godly.</p>
               <p>Now there is no Contradiction at all in this, for the ſame Man at the ſame time, to be <hi>legally</hi> ungodly, and <hi>Evangelically</hi> Godly, becauſe it is with reſpect to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Laws and Covenants, that ſuch contrary things are affirmed of him. Let our Author, if he pleaſe, conſult <hi>Turretine,</hi> and he will find that, that Learned Calviniſt ſaith expreſly,

                  <hi>That a true Believer when he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> is, <hi>(impius, partim antecedenter, partim reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivè ad Juſtificationem, non autem concomitanter:) Ungodly, partly ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi> (and that is, becauſe he was altogether ungodly in former

               <p>If our Author upon this ſhould ſay to us, what he ſaith to his poor awakened Sinner, <hi>That it is Non-ſenſe, Ignorance and Pride,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 31.32.</note> to maintain that a Man muſt be in ſome meaſure Godly in Diſpoſition and Principle before he be Godly in Act, and that he muſt actually believe with a Godly Faith in Order of Nature before he he juſtified, for this is as much as to ſay, that a Man muſt be pretty well recovered before he make uſe of the Phyſician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould reply, (1.) That as for his Poor awakened Sinner, he makes a <hi>poor Fool</hi> of him, he puts what Words he pleaſes in his Mouth, and makes him ſay in effect, that if he firſt had Faith, before he firſt had Faith, then he would firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before he had firſt believed; which we think no Man ever thought or ſaid, nor is capable of ſaying, unleſs it be ſome poor Creature, that is awakened out of his right Wits, or elſe it be ſuch an one as our Author, who hath the Art of Believing or Writing Contradictions.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That he had need to take heed that he do not blaſpheme our Saviour, who hath ſaid that the Tree muſt be good, before the Fruit can be good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16, 17, 18. and 12. <hi>v.</hi> 33. And that is as much as if he had ſaid, what we hold, that there muſt be ſome Renovation of the Inward Diſpoſition of the Heart, before a Man do actually believe with a ſaving juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That if our Author will not believe us, let him believe his own beloved ſelf, for he ſays, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. That <hi>a Man is to believe that be may be juſtified.</hi> And that neceſſarily implies, that he muſt bring forth ſome good Fruit in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before he be juſtified, and in <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. He himſelf quotes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33. To prove that the Tree muſt be good before the Fruit be good.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) We believe, that our Heavenly Phyſician comes firſt to us (ordinarily in the Miniſtry of the Word,) by his preventing Grace, and doth indeed recover us in part by curing the deadneſs and indiſpoſedneſs of our Hearts, before we go to him by an actual ſaving juſtifying Faith, and thereby imploy him for our Juſtification. Chriſt comes firſt to us by his Word and Spirit, and begins to cure us of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deadneſs to any thing that is ſavingly good, before we go to him by actual ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, and be by him delivered from our Legal Death, in Juſtification by Faith in his Blood.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) If our Author will yet go on to tell the People, that we teach them not to employ the Phyſician of Souls, till they have firſt pretty well cured themſelves; we take Heaven and Earth to witneſs, that he belies us, and abuſes the Simplicity of the People: for we believe in our Hearts, and confeſs with our Mouths to the Glory of Chriſt the Phyſician of Souls, that it is he who by his Word, Spirit and Grace both begins, carries on and perfects the cure of all his ſelect People; and that he doth it in the way and order ſet forth in his Word, of which we have here given the World an account, according to that meaſure of Light, which it hath pleaſed him of his rich Mercy, and free Grace to beſtow upon us.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) And laſtly, We deſire it may be conſidered, whether our Authors ſaying, that to tell the People, [they muſt begin to be Godly through Grace, by being Penitent Believers in order to their being juſtified, is all one as to tell them, that they muſt be pretty well recovered and muſt cure themſelves before they employ Chriſt the Phyſician of Souls]; we ſay it is our deſire, People would conſider, whether this be not a piece of <hi>Antinomian Cant,</hi> for it is certain that this is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> one of the groſſeſt of that Sect in <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>the Promiſes belong to Sinners as Sinners, not as repenting or humbled Sinners;</hi> as is to be ſeen in <hi>Gatakers Shadows without Subſtance,</hi> Pag. 53.</p>
               <p>And again ſaith <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> (like our Author in this) <hi>Do you look, that Men ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93177:79"/>be firſt whole for the Phyſician, or Righteous for Pardon of Sin, or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>Pag.</hi> 54.</note> or rather Sinners, Unrighteous, Ungodly.</hi> And <hi>Gataker</hi> there Confutes this precious Stuff in <hi>Pag.</hi> 54, 55, 56, 57, 58. Again, <hi>You</hi> Saltmarſh <hi>ſay, that every one who receives Chriſt, receives him in a ſinful Condition, and conſequently in an impenitent one,</hi> Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 73. And again, ſaith <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> (as our Author doth in <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. of his Letter) <hi>Can any Man believe too ſoon?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gatakers <hi>ſhadows without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> p. 75.</note> To which Queſtion, <hi>Gataker</hi> Anſwers, <hi>No more than he can repent too ſoon.</hi> Thus we have at large anſwered every thing which we can find in the Letter that looks like an Objection or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Truth which we believe, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>But after all, it may be ſome will ſeriouſly put this Queſtion? Is it likely that God will give us any Grace to ſanctifie us in any Kind or Degree, before he ſo love us as to juſtifie us? To which we anſwer, that it is not only likely to be, but it certainly is ſo, that God loves us ſo far, as to make Conditional Promiſes to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his People, and ſo far as to give them for Chriſts ſake Grace to begin to perform the Condition, before he ſo far love them, <hi>as actually to juſtifie them for Chriſts</hi> ſake; and that we ſay is a giving of Grace to ſanctifie us Initially, or to begin a Holy change in us before we be actually juſtified, and our Sins be forgiven us. This we have ſo clearly proved by Scripture and Reaſon, and the Teſtimony of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> that there can be no juſt ground to doubt of it. And if it were otherwiſe, and we were juſtified before we were ſanctified in any Kind or Degree, that is, before there were any Holy Change wrought in us, before we did begin to Convert and turn to God, before we had any Holy Inclination to believe, or any Holy Act of Faith and Repentance, and any Holy purpoſe to lead a new Life; then might we continue to be actually juſtified and pardoned without being in any Kind or Degree ſanctified; becauſe by the ſame Reaſon that Juſtification might be begun without any Kind or Degree of Sanctification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſaving Faith and Repentance, it might be continued without them.</p>
               <p>But all true Proteſtants <hi>(except Antinomians)</hi> even our Author himſelf, confeſs that Juſtification cannot be continued without any Sanctification, without any true Faith and Repentance, therefore Juſtification cannot be begun before and without them. If any ſhould ſay, that this Argument may be retorted upon our ſelves, for we confeſs, that <hi>Sanctification</hi> begun in the Seed, Principle and Diſpoſition, with Vital Acts of Faith and Repentance flowing from it, cannot be continued without <hi>Juſtification;</hi> therefore it follows by our own way of Reaſoning, that they cannot be begun before Juſtification at firſt. We Anſwer, by denying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe God hath expreſly promiſed Juſtification through Chriſt to all, that from a new Heart believe and repent, and ſuch Faith and Repentance are the Condition on which Juſtification is promiſed. But God hath no where promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed either Initial or Progreſſive Sanctification on Condition of Juſtification. This ſhows that our Argument cannot be juſtly retorted upon us; becauſe there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reaſon to the contrary, a Reaſon from the Promiſe of God that ſhews San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Faith and Repentance cannot poſſibly be continued without Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; whereas if Juſtification might be begun without any Degree of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Faith and Repentance, there can no ſufficient Reaſon be given (we think) why it might not be long continued without any Degree of Sanctification, or any Act of Faith and Repentance. As for the promiſe of the Spirit to ſanctifie them who are juſtified, it is made to, and got by Faith, by our Authors own Confeſſion;
<note place="margin">Let. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> and ſo it preſuppoſes Faith, and Faith preſuppoſes Effectual Calling, and a Heart Renovation and Sanctification begun. Now this makes for us, and ſhews that if Sanctification begun in the firſt change of the Heart, and firſt Acts of Faith and Repentance did not go before, there would be no place for the Promiſe of the Spirit after Juſtification, to carry on and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93177:79"/>the begun Sanctification; becauſe there would be no ſuch Perſon in the World as that Promiſe is made to, for the Promiſe of the Spirit to ſanctifie us throughly after Juſtification, is made to true Believers, which none can be till they be firſt initially ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, not yet inhabiting, but fitting up a Spiritual Houſe for himſelf to inhabit; which when he hath done, and God hath thereupon juſtified us through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, then according to his Promiſe he gives us his ſanctifying Spirit to dwell in us, and to carry on the work begun unto Perfection. Thus we have made good what we undertook, and have proved that there is ſome Preparation, ſome Holy Diſpoſition and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſome Holy Principle wrought in the Soul, and ſome Holy Acts of Faith and Repentance produced by the Soul in order to, and before Juſtification, and that thereupon Juſtification follows neceſſarily and infallibly according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, who cannot poſſibly lye and deceive. But as we ſaid at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we hold this Priority of Initial Sanctification, and of the firſt vital Acts of Faith and Repentance, no farther than is neceſſary to verifie the expreſſions and fence of Holy Scripture concerning them; and ſo we conclude this part of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with that of the Learned <hi>Turretine,</hi> [<hi>Licet Poenitentiae,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Remiſſion of Sins be Promiſed to Repentance,

                        <hi>Inſtit. Theol.

               <div type="appendix">
                  <head>An <hi>Appendix</hi> of the third Section, concerning Diſpoſitions previous to Regeneration, and through Converſion.</head>
                  <p>WE Remember, that in our Preliminaries to the foreſaid Diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preparations and Diſpoſitions that are Antecedent to Juſtification, we ſaid that as there are ſome, which have a neceſſary infallible Connection with Juſtification, (of which we have ſpoken already) ſo there are others which have not ſuch a neceſſary infallible Connection with it: As to this laſt ſort, we do not ſay, that they are Diſpoſitions and Preparations, with which Men <hi>are always,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they <hi>are never,</hi> nor <hi>ever can poſſibly</hi> be juſtified; yet we think that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they do precede Juſtification and Effectual Vocation too, in all that are Effectually Called and Juſtified.</p>
                  <p>All ſuch Diſpoſitions and Preparations, our Author denies in the 12th <hi>Page</hi> of his Letter, and pretends that <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminster</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines, do all concur with him therein. We do not at all wonder, that he denies all Preparations and Diſpoſitions before Effectual Calling, and the firſt ſaving Converſion, ſince (as we have ſeen) he denies that there is any good wrought in us, or done by us before Juſtification. And as for Preparations and Diſpoſitions before Converſion, if he would or could aſſure us, that he denies them in no other ſenſe, than all his Authors, <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines do deny them, we ſhould have no controverſie with him about that matter; but we think that he is of a different Judgment, and either doth not underſtand in what ſenſe it is that they deny them, or if he underſtand them aright, he doth not believe them, or if he believe ſome part that he likes, yet he doth not believe all that they ſay concerning thoſe Diſpoſitions, previous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Converſion.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:93177:80"/>
                  <p>That it may be clearly known, what our Judgment is concerning thoſe Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that are ordinarily previous to Regeneration and Converſion; we ſhall, (1.) Name them, and ſhew what they are. (2.) Declare what our Opinion is concerning them. (3.) Shew that our Opinion concerning them, is neither new nor ſingular, but what we believe in this matter, we have learned and received from the moſt eminent Paſtors of the Reformed Churches, whereof many lived and died in the true Faith, before many of us were born.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then to Name them, there is</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) An Illumination of the Mind by the Word and Spirit of God, by means whereof Sinners come to know more of God and of his Word, particularly of his Law, than ever they did before.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) There is a Conviction of their Conſcience, that they have frequently and hainouſly tranſgreſſed Gods Law, in habit and Act, in Heart and Life. And by their Sins Original and Actual are fallen under the curſe of the broken Law, and the Wrath of the offended Law-giver.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) There thence ariſeth in them a fear of the Wrath and Vengeanceof an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Thereupon they begin to be ſorry, that by their Sin and Folly, they have brought themſelves into ſuch a dangerous Condition, and to humble themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; if ſo be that his Wrath may be turned away from them.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) The Light, whereby the Word and Spirit had given them a clearer Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of themſelves, than ever they had before, and of their obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Gods Everlaſting Wrath and Vengeance, is increaſed by the Goſpel, and thereby is given them ſome Diſcovery and Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt the only begotten Son of God, as one whom God hath ordained to be the Saviour of loſt Sinners of Mankind, and to reconcile them unto God by ſatisfying his offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and by Meriting for them his Grace and Favour.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Upon this Knowledge of Chriſt, there follows ſome kind of common Faith and Hope, that it is poſſible for them in particular to get their Sins pardoned and their Souls ſaved, through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.27.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) Then there ariſeth ſome Joy in them, from the foreſaid Faith and Hope of the poſſibility of their obtaining ſo great Salvation, from the Curſe of the Law and Wrath of the Law-giver, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) This Joy and Gladneſs of Heart, ariſing from the Hope of the Poſſibility of their obtaining ſo great Salvation, makes them deſire that that poſſibility may be reduced into Act, and that they may actually obtain the poſſible Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) The deſire of actually obtaining it, makes them in ſome ſort willing to uſe the means appointed by God for obtaining ſo deſirable an end; whereupon they give themſelves to conſider, What thoſe means are, and how to uſe them? and from that they proceed to read and <hi>hear the</hi> Word of God <hi>more than formerly,</hi> to pray unto God themſelves, and to deſire the Prayers of others, for the pardon of their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls.</p>
                  <p n="10">(10.) And laſtly, They endeavour to reform their Lives, by abſtaining from the outward Commiſſion of thoſe Sins, which they have been moſt groſly guilty of, and which do moſt burden their Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Diſpoſitions, which are previous to Regeneration and a through Converſion, for we humbly conceive it poſſible for Sinners to go thus far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, before they attain unto, a ſaving Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To declare what our Opinion is concerning theſe Diſpoſitions previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Converſion. (1.) We do not think, that they are all abſolutely neceſſary on Gods part, as if he could not poſſibly Convert a Sinner immediately without ſuch foregoing Diſpoſitions. We know nothing to the contrary, but that God can come unto a Sinner by the powerful Operation of his Spirit and Grace (if he pleaſe,) in the midſt of his greateſt and deepeſt unpreparedneſs, and turn him from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93177:80"/>his Sin and bring him to Chriſt by ſaving Converſion immediately. But yet.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) We do not think, that this is Gods uſual way of drawing Sinners to Chriſt, for though ſuch previous Diſpoſitions to Converſion be not abſolutely neceſſary on Gods part; yet they are ordinarily neceſſary on mens part, eſpecially in Countreys where God hath planted Churches, hath ſent Miniſters to preach the Goſpel publickly, and hath eſtabliſhed a courſe of outward viſible means; we think, that in ſuch places, though God hath not tied himſelf to means, yet he hath tied men to the uſe of them, and that they have never ſo much Reaſon to expect Gods ſpecial help and Effectual Aſſiſtance for their faving Converſion, as when they are uſing their beſt endeavours, in the uſe of the means which God himſelf has ordained for the communicating of his ſaving Grace to loſt Sinners of Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The foreſaid Preparations, which we believe to be ordinarily neceſſary on mans part, we do not judge to be the product of meer natural Light and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Man, but to be the effect of common Grace; which Grace we call common, becauſe not only the Elect, but the Non elect alſo are made partakers of it in the Viſible Church; and we hold it to be of a ſupernatural Order of Beings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thoſe who are made partakers of it, are enabled to do things that are above their meer natural Capacity, and which they could not poſſibly do of themſelves, without that ſupernatural Help and Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) We do not believe, that any thing, or all that man doth by the help of the ſaid ſupernatural common Grace, is Meritorious either (<hi>ex condigno</hi> or <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo</hi>) of Condignity or of Congruity, of ſpecial ſaving Grace, ſo as God ſhould be obliged, and could not with Honour but give ſpecial ſaving Grace to thoſe unto whom he hath firſt given the foreſaid common Grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Yet we think, that God doth not take away the ſaid common Grace from any to whom he hath given it, till they have firſt forfeited it, and provoked God to take it from them by their neglecting to improve it, as they ought and might have done. For we are of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> Opinion in this matter, as he expreſſeth it in his Diſcourfe concerning the Holy Spirit, <hi>Pag.</hi> 198. <hi>Where ſpecial Grace, and real Converſion is not attained</hi> (to wit, by means of common Grace, and its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on the Soul) <hi>it is always from the Interpoſition of an Act of Wilfulneſs and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs in thoſe Englightned and Convicted, they do not ſincerely improve what they have received, and faint, not meerly for want of Strength to proceed,</hi> but <hi>by a free Act of their own Wills, they refuſe the Grace which is further tendred unto them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> From this Paſſage of Dr. <hi>Owens,</hi> we ſee that according to him the only culpable Reaſon, why thoſe who have the foreſaid common Grace, and thereby go ſo far in the way to Converſion, but yet do not attain the end, do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſpecial Grace and ſaving Converſion thereby, is becauſe they were groſly wanting in their Duty to God and themſelves, of improving common Grace as far as it would go.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Though we thus ſhew, that men themſelves are the only culpable Cauſe of their not obtaining ſpecial Grace and ſaving Converſion thereby, yet we do not ſay on the other hand, that the Elect are the laudable Cauſe of their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly obtaining ſpecial Grace and ſaving Converſion thereby. No, no, we are no ſuch Perſons, we hold no ſuch Opinions; but are of <hi>Proſpers</hi> Mind, and ſay with him, [<hi>Quantumlibet impiorum malignitas accuſetur,
<note place="margin">Proſper <hi>de vocat. Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25.</note> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens gratiae dei, nurquid probabuntur, eam quibus eſt collata meruiſſe? aut illa virtus gratiae, quae ſibi quos volicit ſubdidit, convertere eos qui incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibiles permanſere, non potuit? tales fuerunt qui ſunt attracti, quales bi qui in ſuâ duritiâ ſunt relicti, fed illis tribuit gratia ſtupenda, quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, iſtis tribuit veritas juſta quod debuit, ut judicium Dei magis inſcrutabile ſit in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione gratiae, quam in retributione juſtitiae.</hi> 
                     <q>How much ſoever the Malignity of the Wicked, which reſiſts the Grace of God be accuſed, can it ever be proved,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93177:81"/>that they to whom ſpecial Grace is given, have deſerved or merited it? Or that powerful Efficacy of Grace, which hath ſubdued to it ſelf whom it would; could it not convert thoſe who remained unconverted? They who are drawn to the Lord were ſuch as thoſe are who are left in their hardneſs. But wonderful aſtoniſhing Grace gave what it would to thoſe that are converted; and juſt Truth, that, is the True and Juſt God rendered what he owed unto the others who are unconverted: So that the Judgment of God is more unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the election of Grace, than in the Retribution of Juſtice.</q> That is, it is more difficult to give a reaſon why God gives ſpecial effectual converting Grace to ſuch and ſuch particular perſons, who could never deſerve to have it, than why he with-holds it from other perſons who have really deſerved to want it.]</p>
                  <p>This is the true meaning of the laſt clauſe of that excellent Writer, whereby we ſee that the Father, on the one hand aſſigns the juſt demerits of the ungodly Reſiſters of Gods Grace, for the reaſon of their not being converted by ſpecial and victorious Grace; but on the other hand he acknowledges that no reaſon can be given why the like reſiſtance is overcome and taken away, in the Elect, and they are ſavingly converted, by diſcriminating Grace, but that it is Gods good will and pleaſure to have it ſo; of the ſame judgment are we in this matter, and as we derive the reaſon on the part of Gods Select People, why they rather than others are infallibly converted by ſpecial Grace, from the meer will and pleaſure of God, (becauſe we know no other reaſon of it), ſo we aſcribe unto God all the Glory of it, ſaying with our Bleſſed Saviour; <hi>We thank thee O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent,
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25, 26.</note> and hast revealed them unto Babes. Even ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we have briefly declared what our opinion is, concerning the Preparations and Diſpoſitions which ordinarily go before ſaving Converſion, in ſome more, in others leſs, in ſome for a longer, in others for a ſhorter time; but in all ſo as to enlighten, convince, and humble them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Now in the third and laſt place we ſhall ſhow that our opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, is neither new nor ſingular, but that what we believe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we have learned and received from the moſt Eminent Paſtors of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, whereof many lived and died in the true Faith, before many of us were born.</p>
                  <p>And our firſt Witneſs is <hi>Calvin,</hi> who writing againſt <hi>Pighius,</hi> doth plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Sinners are diſpoſed and prepared by the Grace of Gods Holy Spirit, before they be ſavingly converted and juſtified. His words are theſe, [<hi>Neque verò hoc medo praeparari hominem ad recipiendum juſtitiae donum, negamus; ſed Spiritus Sancti directione,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Pighium, de lib. arbit. lib.</hi> 5. §. <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducit tamen.</hi>
                        </note> non ſuo ingenio,</hi> &amp;c. <q>But neither do we deny that man is thus prepared to receive the gift of Righteuſneſs; but it is by the direction of the Holy Spirit, and not by his own natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and ſtrength. Chriſt doth not call any to come unto him, but ſuch as labour and are heavy laden: But yet it is he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who makes us to feel our burden, and to groan under it. We confeſs that the common Proverb is moſt true, that it is the only hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a cure, where the ſick Perſon is ſenſible of his Diſeaſe. Therefore that Chriſt may become thy Phyſician, it behoves thee to acknowledge and be ſenſible of thy Diſeaſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again in his Inſtitutions, he expreſly confeſſes that there are ſome common operations of the Spirit,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Idem Inſtit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 11.</note> whereof the <hi>Non-Elect</hi> are partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the viſible Church. <hi>Experientia (inquit) oſtendit; reprobos inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fimili ferè ſenſu atque Electos affici; ut ne ſuo quidem judicio quicquam ab electis differant,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Experience (ſays <hi>Calvin</hi>) ſhews that the Reprobate are ſometimes affected with a ſenſe and feeling (to wit of Spiritual
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93177:81"/>things), almoſt like to that which is in the Elect; in ſo much that in their own Judgment, they differ not at all from the Elect. Wherefore there is no abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all in this, that by the Apoſtle, a taſte of Heavenly Gifts; and by Chriſt, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith is aſcribed unto them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Calvin,</hi> who there ſhews that in the Elect after ſaving Converſion and Juſtification, there is always ſomething of a higher nature which differenceth them from the <hi>Non-elect,</hi> and then adds, <hi>[Sed hoc minimè obſtat quin illa inferior Spiritus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio curſum ſuum habeat etiam in reprobis.]</hi> 
                     <q>Yet this doth no ways hinder, but that that inferiour operation of the Spirit hath its courſe even in the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</q> And more he hath to this purpoſe; whereby it evidently appears that in his Judgment, there is ſuch a thing as we call common Grace, which oftentimes makes ſuch a change upon the Unregenerate, that it is hard to diſtinguiſh them from the truely Regenerate.</p>
                  <p>We might alſo alledge to this purpoſe the Teſtimonies of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> in his <hi>Examination of the Council of Trent;</hi> of the Divines of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus our Divines in the Synod, and with the approbation of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> gave their Judgment at large, and the grounds and reaſons of it, concerning the diſpoſitions which are ordinarily previous to Regeneration and ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; all which we have tranſcribed word for word, out of their Collegiate ſuffrage, that the world may ſee that our opinion concerning Preparations and Diſpoſitions, previous to ſaving Converſation, is neither new nor ſingular, but is the very ſame with that of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> from whom we learned it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now we will ſhew that this ſame Doctrine of our Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> is received and approved by thoſe very Divines whom our Authour in his Letter would ſuborn to be Witneſſes againſt us in the Controverſie between him and us; we ſhall demonſtrate this by the Teſtimonies of Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who do all three expreſſy approve of the ſuffrage of our <hi>Britain Divines</hi> in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> hath an intire Diſputation againſt <hi>Maccovius,</hi> concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a Sinner to Converſion. It and ſome other Diſſertations of his, are ordinarily bound up with his ſhort Scholaſtical reply to <hi>Grevinchovius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that Diſputation, after he had in the firſt <hi>Poſition</hi> rejected (as we have done) all Diſpoſitions any wiſe meritorious of Juſtification; in the ſecond <hi>Poſition</hi> he ſays, <hi>That becauſe there are no meritorious Diſpoſitions, for that reaſon ſo to hate the very name</hi> (Diſpoſition), <hi>as without any distinction to take away and deny all Preparatory affections and motions in a Sinner, whereby God makes way for his Congruous Converſion, and in ſome ſort puts him in an order and courſe of Actions, which have a tendency unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, this is as judiciouſly and wiſely do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, as if one ſhould abſolutely deny that there are any good Works at all, becauſe meritorious works are juſtly condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his 3d. Poſition, <hi>But we doubt not to aſſert,</hi> (ſays <hi>Ames,</hi>) <hi>that in every Sinner of ripe years who is to be Converted, ordinarily ſome diſpoſitions tending to Converſion, go before it, altho in a different degree, according to the wiſe diſpenſation of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in his 5th. Poſition, <hi>De istis (inquit) nihil certius eſt, quâm quod in Syn.</hi> Dord: <hi>ad art.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Propoſuerunt Theologi Britanni, ſunt quaedam opera, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Concerning thoſe Diſpoſitions (ſays <hi>Ames</hi>) Nothing is more certain than that which the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93177:83"/>Divines</hi> propoſed in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> upon the 3d. and 4th. Articles, There are ſome external works ordinarily required of men, before they be brought to the ſtate of Regeneration or Converſion.</q> And there are ſome internal Effects previous to Converſion or Regeneration, which by the power of the Word and Spirit are ſtirred up in the hearts of thoſe who are not yet juſtified, ſuch are the knowledge of Gods will, ſenſe of ſin, fear of Puniſhment, thought of deliverance, <q>ſome hope of pardon. For as in the natural Generation of man, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny previous diſpoſitions, ſo alſo in the Spiritual Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Thus <hi>Ames</hi> highly approved what we have quoted before at large out of the Suffrage. Then he quotes <hi>Perkins</hi> for the ſame opinion in his caſes of Conſcience; <hi>Book</hi> 1. c. 5.</p>
                  <p>In his 8th, Poſition, <q>So great (ſays <hi>Ames</hi>) is the evidence of this Truth, that he who oppoſeth it, by one raſh Sentence ſeems to blot out the whole firſt part of the Catechiſm, with a great part of the Second; and alſo to abrogate and make void the whole Miniſtery of the Word in order to the Converſion of Sinners. ☞ For as there is no uſe of the Miniſtery with reſpect to the Regenerate but that they may be prepared for and brought unto Glory, ſo there is no uſe of it with reſpect to the Unregenerate, but that they may be prepared for, and brought unto Converſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his 9th. Poſition, he brings two places of Scripture to prove that there are ſuch diſpoſitions previous to Converſion; <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God;</hi> Acts 2.37. <hi>When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart.</hi> Upon both theſe places of Scripture he quotes <hi>Calvin, Obſerving from them that there are Preparations and Diſpoſitions previous to ſaving Converſion.</hi> Let Scholars conſult the Author himſelf, and read the whole Diſputation if they pleaſe. What we have tranſcribed out of it, is abundantly ſufficient to demonſtrate that <hi>Ames</hi> is on our ſide, and approved the ſaid Doctrine of our <hi>Britain Divines</hi> in the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hoard,</hi> his Book called, <hi>Gods love unto Mankind,</hi> diſcourſing there of what our Divines at <hi>Dort,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Twiſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hoard</hi> p. 205.</note> on the Fifth Article, ſaid concerning the change which by Gods Word and Spirit is wrought in the minds, affections and manners of men, even of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect, before Converſion and Juſtification; he ſays Expreſly: <q>That the diſpoſitions which God grants unto men before ſaving Converſion, as they are in the Elect, they are preparations to further Grace; and ſo in the Reprobate they might be preparations to further Grace, if it pleaſed God ſo to ordain as to bring them on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Juſtification, and true Sanctification conjunct therewith, and thereby unto Salvation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which words we obſerve two things, (1) That Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> abſolutely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that the previous Diſpoſitions which God by his Word and Spirit works in the Elect before Converſion and Regeneration, are preparations to further Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) As for the like Diſpoſitions wrought by the Word and Spirit in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate who are never Converted and Regenerated, he affirms not that they are <hi>de facto,</hi> but that they might be in them alſo, preparations, unto further Grace, upon ſuppoſition that it pleaſed God to give them the like ſpecial effectual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace which he gives unto the Elect.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards in the ſame Book he approves what our Divines ſay on the 3d. and 4th. Articles, concerning previous diſpoſitions, and which we have quoted out of them at large; only he ſaith, he doth not ſufficiently underſtand the laſt Clauſe of their Argument to prove their third Poſition, Which is, <hi>[That calling by the Word and Spirit, cannot be thought to leave men inexcuſable, which is only exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this end, to make them unexcuſable.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Twiſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hoard</hi> p. 218.</note> This is the only thing in that Diſcourſe of theirs concerning previous Diſpoſitions which Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> pretends not to underſtand. Yet at the ſame time he ſays, <q>That he thinks (by Gods making men unexcuſeable) they meant Gods ſo taking away all excuſe from men, as that thereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93177:84"/>faulty and culpable before God, for want of a ſufficient excuſe, which he grants to be the ordinary meaning of the (word <hi>unexcuſable);</hi> and then he adds [In this ſenſe I willingly ſubſcribe unto them, and therewithall ſhew what I take to be their meaning, namely this, that if God, making ſhew that if they believe he will accept them, and that they ſhall be ſaved, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mean that he would in that caſe, accept and ſave them, then there were no reaſon why they ſhould be accounted faulty, and condemned for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus, (ſays he) in a deſire exactly to conform my ſelf to the Judgment of theſe Worthies of our Church, made choice of by our Soveraign, to be ſent in ſo honourable an Ambaſſage, to countenance that famous Synod of the moſt Reformed Churches: I have made bold to Interpret them, and to ſhow my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with them,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this paſſage it is evident that he approved all they wrote on that head of diſpoſitions previous to Regeneration. For he ſcrupled only one Clauſe, which he ſo Interpreted as to remove the ground of the Scruple, and then declared his Concurrence with them in that which he took to be the true ſenſe of their words, and indeed he needed not to have made any ſuch Scrupulous Objection, as he there doth; for undoubtedly our Divines uſed the word <hi>(unexcuſable)</hi> there, in no other ſenſe, but what he yields to at laſt and approves of. <hi>To wit,</hi> That that calling by the Word and Spirit, cannot be thought to leave men faulty by taking away their excuſe, which is <hi>only deſigned and exhibited</hi> to make them faulty for want of an excuſe. It appears plainly by the whole Series and Contexture of their diſcourſe, that this was the meaning of our moſt Learned and Judicious Divines; and conſequently that there is no difference between <hi>Twiſs</hi> and them in this matter. Eſpecially it is moſt evident that <hi>Twiſs</hi> and they exactly agreed, that in the Elect the foreſaid Diſpoſitions before Converſion, are Preparations to further Grace, even to the ſpeciall Grace of ſaving Converſion it ſelf: And this is the main thing that we now enquire after; <hi>to wit,</hi> Whether there be any preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpoſitions in the Elect before Converſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> alſo in his Diſcourſe in <hi>Folio,</hi> concerning the Holy Spirit, quotes the Judgment of our <hi>Brittain Divines</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> concerning the foreſaid diſpoſitions previous to Regeneration,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Owens <hi>diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the work of the Holy Spirit; Book</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196.</note> and approves it, and goes the ſame way that they do, in diſcourſing of them, and ſhewing what they are and how they are wrought. <q>Firſt (ſays he) in reference unto the work of Regeneration it ſelf, poſitively conſidered, we may obſerve, that ordinarily there are certain previous and preparatory works, or workings in and upon the Souls of men, that are antecedent and diſpoſitive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: But yet Regeneration doth not conſiſt in them, nor can it be educed out of them. This is for the ſubſtance of it, the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divines of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> two whereof died Biſhops, and others of them were dignified in the Hierarchy. I mention it, that thoſe (new Divines) by whom theſe things are deſpiſed, may a little conſider whoſe aſhes they trample on and ſcorn.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Dr. tells us (1.) That he ſpeaks not of the Regeneration of Infants, but of the adult. (2.) That the diſpoſitions previous to their Regeneration are not formal but <hi>material diſpoſitions.</hi> (3.) That ſome of them are attainable <hi>by the power of nature</hi> alone, ſuch as are outward attendance on the diſpenſation of the Word, and a diligent intenſion of mind in attending on the means of Grace, to underſtand and receive the things revealed, and declared as the mind and will of God: and he ſays, that the omitting or neglecting to uſe this natural ability, <hi>is the principal occaſion and cauſe of the eternal ruin of the Souls of the Generality of them, to whom, or amongſt whom the Goſpel is preached,</hi> John 3.19.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) That there are certain <hi>Internal Spiritual Effects</hi> wrought in and upon the Souls of Men, whereof the Word preached, is the immediate Inſtrumental cauſe,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93177:84"/>which <hi>ordinarily do precede the work</hi> of Regeneration, or real Converſion unto God: And they are reduceable unto Three Heads, (1.) Illumination. (2.) Conviction. (3. Reformation. The firſt of theſe reſpects the Mind only. The ſecond the Mind, Conſcience and Affections. And the third, the Life and Converſation. Theſe are attained by the <hi>inward influence of the Holy, Spirit</hi> upon mens Souls, concurring with the Word to make it effectual unto thoſe ends.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things may be wrought in the minds of men by the diſpenſation of the Word, <hi>and yet the work of Regeneration be never perfected in them.</hi> Yea, <hi>although they are good in themſelves, and fruits of the kindneſs of God towards us;</hi> they may not only be <hi>loſt</hi> as unto any Spiritual advantage, but alſo be abuſed to our great diſadvantage. Then Pag. 196. <hi>The Dectrine</hi> (ſays he) <hi>concerning theſe things, hath been variouſly handled, diſtinguiſhed and applyed, by many Learned Divines, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of the Goſpel, Unto that Light which they received into them from the infallible Word of God, they ſoined thoſe experiences which they had obſerved in their own hearts, and the Conſciences of others with whom they had to do, which were ſuitable thereunto. And in the diſpenſation of this truth, according to the meaſure of the gift of the Grace of Chriſt, which they ſeverally received, they had an uſeful and fruitful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the World, to the Converting of many unto God. ☞ But we have lived to ſee all theſe things decried and rejected.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> concerning Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions previous to Regeneration, whoſe ſenſe upon the whole, we have here briefly and faithfully repreſented unto all into whoſe hands this may come. And in the firſt and latter part of this long quotation, we have tranſcribed his own words.</p>
                  <p>By all which we ſee that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> received and approved as true, good and uſeful, the foreſaid Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh Divines</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Diſpoſitions and Preparations before Regeneration; and ſeems to have ſaid it with ſome grief, that he had lived to ſee all theſe things decryed and rejected, <hi>to wit,</hi> by ſome <hi>Arminian Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> And would it not have grieved him a little more, to have ſeen all theſe things decryed and rejected alſo by <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> that pretend to be the only party of Proteſtants who adhere to the old pure Doctrine of the beſt Reformed Churches; when at the ſame time and in the ſame thing they join with the <hi>new</hi> Divines, (as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> expreſly calls them) that is, with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> againſt the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and the old Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> But you may ſay, doth our Author do ſo? doth he decry and reject thoſe Preparations and Diſpoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Regeneration and Converſion, which our Divines maintained in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> maintained after them againſt modern <hi>Arminians?</hi> We anſwer, if he doth not decry and reject them, what means all that which he writes in the 12 page of his Letter againſt all Preparations and Diſpoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſaving and juſtifying Faith? Surely he took wrong meaſures if the thought that thoſe diſpoſitions might be admitted before Regeneration and Converſion, but not before a ſaving and juſtifying Faith. For it is ſimply impoſſible, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a contradiction, that they can be before Regeneration and firſt ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but they muſt be alſo before ſaving and juſtifying Faith. So that either he muſt contradict himſelf after his uſual manner, if he hold the foreſaid diſpoſitions to be before Regeneration and Converſion, but not before ſaving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith; or if he affirm that they are neither before Regeneration and Converſion, nor yet before ſaving Faith, which is neceſſarily implyed in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Converſion; then indeed he doth not contradict himſelf, but he doth that which is worſe, he contradicts the Truth, and the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who all maintain this Truth that the ſaid preparatory diſpoſitions are before Regeneration and Converſion, and ſo before a ſaving juſtifying Faith.</p>
                  <p>If he ſays that he doth not deny them to be before Regeneration and Saving Juſtifying Faith, nor to be diſpoſitive thereunto, but that he only denies them to be diſpoſitive unto Juſtification.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93177:85"/>
                  <p>We Anſwer, (1.) That then he yields the Cauſe, and comes over to us; for we do not ſay that any thing before Regeneration and ſaving juſtifying Faith, is or can be immediately Diſpoſitive unto Juſtification; but that the foreſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations are Diſpoſitive unto Regeneration and Converſion, which are in Order before Juſtification. (2.) Then he is as much bound to Anſwer his own Argument againſt their being Diſpoſitive unto Juſtification, as we are; for his Argument is this, that nothing a Man doth before ſaving juſtifying Faith, can diſpoſe him for Juſtification, becauſe it is all Sin, and Sin can never diſpoſe a Man for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be true, if all that a Man doth before ſaving juſtifying Faith, be Sin, if <hi>it be vain labour, and an Acting of Sin,</hi> and therefore cannot diſpoſe him for Juſtification; then for the ſame Reaſon, it cannot diſpoſe him for Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and ſaving juſtifying Faith; for it is ſelf-evident, that that which is vain labour, and nothing but Sin, can no more diſpoſe a Man for Regeneration, than for Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Sin can diſpoſe a Man for nothing, but for Sin and Puniſhment; and if that which is vain labour could diſpoſe a Man for Regeneration and Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would at once be both vain labour, and not vain labour; it would be vain labour, for ſo it is ſaid and ſuppoſed to be; and it would not be vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, becauſe it diſpoſes a Man for Regeneration and Converſion, and that is not vain labour which is uſeful to ſo good an end as the Regenerating and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Man is.</p>
                  <p>But (1.) our Author Objects <hi>the</hi> 13th <hi>Article of the Church of</hi> England. To which we Anſwer, (1.) That the Engliſh Divines at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Articles of their own Church much better than our Author doth, and yet they found nothing in the 13th Article againſt Diſpoſitions before Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wrought in Sinners by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Article ſpeaks <hi>only of Works done by Infidels without any Grace of Chriſt at all, and without any Inſpiration of the Spirit.</hi> Now it is Confeſſed, that ſuch Works are not pleaſant to God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the</hi> 10th <hi>Art.</hi>
                     </note> nor are they Diſpoſitive unto Regeneration and Converſion. But the Works which the Synod of <hi>Dort, Ames, Twiſs</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> affirm to be Preparatory and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitive unto Regeneration and Converſion, are not ſuch Works, they are not works done by the meer Power of Nature without any ſupernatural Grace at all; but they are Works done by <hi>the Power of the Word and Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> they are Works done by a <hi>certain Inferior kind of ſupernatural Grace of Chriſt and Inſpiration of the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> which is ſufficient to elevate and raiſe the Faculties of a Sinner ſomething above its natural Capacity, to the producing of ſuch Actions, which though they be not ſavingly good and ſo not pleaſing to God unto Juſtification and Salvation; yet they are materially good, and <hi>Relatively good too in Order</hi> to the uſe and end for which God has ordained them, that is, they <hi>are Diſpoſitively good,</hi> they have from God ſo much goodneſs as makes them fit to be <hi>a Material Diſpoſition</hi> of the Sinner to receive from God that which is in a higher Order of goodneſs, even that which is ſavingly good; and in this reſpect being good, they are ſo far pleaſing to God, as they are diſpoſitive unto Regeneration and Converſion. Hence it is written, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. That Jeſus beholding an unconverted man, loved him; the Man was certainly as yet in an unregenerated unconverted State, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the 22 <hi>verſe,</hi> and by the following Diſcourſe of our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he was ſomething ſolicitous about his Salvation, and had ſome ſmall weak Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Converſion; which our Saviour obſerved in him, and was pleaſed with it, and loved him under that Conſideration, as ſomething inclined and diſpoſed towards Converſion; now our Saviour as Man and as Mediator was never pleaſed with any thing, but as it was pleaſing to God, and never loved any Man fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God loved him.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93177:85"/>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The Article doth not deny but that the foreſaid Works or Actions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Men, done by the Grace of Chriſt and Inſpiration of his Spirit, are by the Ordination and free Conſtitution of God, Preparatory and Diſpoſitive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reception of ſpecial ſaving Grace in Regeneration and Converſion; But if it intends them at all, it denies that of their own Nature they are meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Diſpoſitive either unto the Grace of Regeneration or Juſtification; for the clearing of this, it is to be well conſidered that before the Reformation there were ſeveral numerous Sects of Schoolmen in the Roman Church, whereof one, to wit, the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> held that a Sinner by doing what he can, as far as his natural Strength will go, without any Supernatural Grace from Chriſt, may Merit the firſt Supernatural Grace, with a Merit of Congruity; and this ſame Doctrine was taught at <hi>Rome</hi> even after the Reformation and Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and publiſhed by <hi>Nider</hi> in a Book intituled, <hi>Conſolatorium timoratae Conſcientiae,</hi> Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year, 1604. as is to be ſeen in the 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2d. <hi>part,</hi> pag. 57. where he maintains that, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt, ſolis naturae viribus, Deus da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now the 13th Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was levelled againſt both theſe Opinions of the Papiſts, eſpecially and expreſly againſt the (1ſt.) <q>Works done by the alone Power of Nature, cannot make Men meet to receive Grace, or they cannot deſerve Grace of Congruity, becauſe they are done before and without any Grace of Chriſt and Inſpiration of his Spirit, and ſo are not pleaſing to God, and what is not pleaſing to him cannot poſſibly Merit the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or Juſtification at his Hand.</q> (2.) Neither the Works done without any Grace of Chriſt, nor the Works done by the help of Chriſts preventing common Grace before Regeneration, make Men meet to receive, or of Congruity deſerve the Grace of Juſtification, becauſe they do not Spring out of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, but are both of them before it, and therefore are not pleaſing to God unto Juſtification and Salvation; yet that nothing hinders, but the Works which are done by the preventing Grace of Chriſt before Converſion, may by Gods free Ordination be Preparatory and Materially Diſpoſitive unto Converſion and Faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) We willingly grant what the Article ſaith, That Works done before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Converſion <hi>have the Nature of Sin,</hi> becauſe they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, that is, they are not ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated as God requires good Works to be. Yet it doth not follow that ſuch of them as are done by the help of preventing Grace, <hi>are Sin and nothing but Sin,</hi> as our Author would make People believe; for it is one thing for a Work to have the Nature of Sin cleaving to it, and it is another thing to be Sin and nothing but Sin; the Works of which we now ſpeak; certainly have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin cleaving to them, as they proceed from an unregenerate Man, whoſe Heart is not yet renewed, and who is not endued with a ſaving Faith, and as they are not directed by him to the Glory of God as the beſt and higheſt end; and yet it, is ſo far from being true, that they are Sin in the abſtrect, and nothing but Sin, that on the contrary, they are <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Subſtantially</hi> good, as they are commanded by God, and as they proceed from the preventing, exciting Grace of Chriſts Spirit, cauſing a Man to do them in Obedience to Gods command; and likewiſe they are <hi>Relatively and Diſpoſitively good,</hi> as they are ordered by God to be a means of preparing and diſpoſing Man for the ſaving Grace of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93177:86"/>and Converſion. Hence Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in the Book aforeſaid, <hi>Pag.</hi> 196. ſaith, <hi>That they are good in themſelves, and Fruits of the kindneſs of God towards us.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 198. <hi>He ſaith, That in their own Nature they have a tendency unto ſincere Converſion.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 167. He ſaith, that <hi>the Spirit of Grace ordinarily giveth not out his Aids and Aſſiſtances any where, but where he preparen the Soul with Diligence in Duty.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> whereby it manifeſtly appears that he was far from thinking, that all a Man can do before he have the Spirit of God dwelling in him, and in Order to a Holy change, firſt in his Heart and then in his Life, is both vain labour, and an Acting of Sin.</p>
                  <p>And as far was Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> from any ſuch thought, for thus he writes in the Book mentioned before:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſwer to the Doctrine of the Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>and</hi> Arles, <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> p. 106.</note> 
                     <hi>[There is a legal Repentance, and there is an Evangelical Repentance. And that legal Repentance may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Deſperation, as</hi> Judas <hi>his Repentance was: Again that legal Repentance may be a Fruit of the Spirit of Bondage, which prepares for the hearing of the Goſpel, and for the receiving of the Spirit of Adoption by the Goſpel; then in the Preaching the Goſpel, the tender Mercies of God diſplayed unto us, and how ready be is to Pardon Sin in general, and that of Free Grace, may better our Repentance; and when we are thus by Degrees brought to the Spirit of Adoption, to cry Abba Father, then our Repentance ſhall be moſt perfect, as before I ſaid. And when we look upon him whom we have pierced, and can in Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, ſay with the Apoſtle; I live by Faith in him who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, this is of Power to prick a Maſter vein, and make us bleed out Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the ſight of our Gracious God (whom we have offended, and who yet in deſpite of our Sins hath loved us) more Devoutly and Affectionately than ever before. Yet is it true, as he</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Arminian <hi>ſaith</hi>) <hi>That Repentance is nothing worth without Faith? what thinks he of</hi> Ahabs <hi>Repentance, when he put on Sackcloath, and wallowed in Aſhes, upon the Word of Judgment againſt his Houſe, brought unto him by the Prophet</hi> Eliah? <hi>Do we not know, what the Lord ſaid hereupon unto</hi> Eliah, <hi>Seeſt thou, how</hi> Ahab <hi>is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before me? becauſe he ſubmitteth himſelf before me, I will not bring that evil in his days. The uttermoſt of the</hi> Ninivites <hi>Faith was but this, that we read of, who can tell if God will turn and Repent, and turn from his fierce Wrath, that we periſh not? Yet their Repentance was ſuch, that when God ſaw their works, that they turned from their Evil Ways, he repented of the Evil which he ſaid, that he would do unto them, and he did it not,</hi> Jon. 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Thus Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> whereby it is evident that he was far from thinking that all which a man can do before he have the Spirit of God dwelling in him, and that he may get a Holy Heart, and a ſaving Faith, and ſo be fitted to lead a Holy Life, is nothing but vain labour and an Acting of Sin.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Secondly, Our Author Objects, <hi>the ſeventh Article of the</hi> 16. <hi>Chapter of the</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Confeſſion of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And our Anſwer is, That that Article of the Confeſſion of Faith, is the ſame in effect with the 13th. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore is to be taken in the ſame Sence, to wit, <q>That the Works of unregenerate men done before and without any Grace of Chriſts Spirit, though they may be materially good, yet they are formally ſo ſinful, that they do not make a Man meet to receive any Grace from God, either the Grace of Regeneration or Juſtification;</q> and as for the Works of unregenerate Men, which are done by the help of ſupernatural prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common Grace, though they be better than the former, which are done by the alone Strength of Nature, yet they are ſinful too, they are ſo defiled with Sin as they proceed from an unregenerate Man, that they cannot pleaſe God, ſo far as to make a Man meet to receive the Grace of Juſtification from God; nor do they make a Man meet to receive the Grace of Regeneration from God, by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due to them as Congruouſly Meritorious thereof. Yet in another ſound ſence they may make a Man meet to receive the Grace of Regeneration and Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93177:86"/>from God, <hi>to wit,</hi> as they are wrought in Men by the Spirit, and according to the Word, and are ordained by God to be means of removing ſuch things as hinder Converſion, and of the helping men forward in the way unto, and of fitting and preparing them for Converſion, as a Gracious Gift which ordinarily God freely gives to thoſe who are ſo prepared by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt. In this ſound ſence (though not in the Popiſh or Semipelagian ſenſe) the foreſaid works do indeed make men meet to receive Grace from God, and the Article of the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> ſaith nothing to the contrary. Yea it is plainly againſt that abſired opinion that all that an Unregenerate man can do by any means, in order to the getting of his heart ſavingly changed and initially ſanctified by the ſpecial effectual Grace of the Regenerating Spirit of Chriſt, is vain labour and an acting of Sin; we ſay that the foreſaid Article of the Confeſſion of Faith is plainly againſt that abſurd opinion, for it ſays expreſly, <hi>That works of Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, are things which God Commands, and are of good uſe both to themſelves and others;</hi> and one of the beſt uſes they can poſſibly be of unto themſelves, is to diſpoſe and prepare them for Regeneration and Converſion, and to make them (if not meet, yet at leaſt) <hi>leſs unmeet,</hi> to receive ſpecial ſaving Grace from God through Jeſus Chriſt. And thus according to the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and our principle agreeable thereunto, we can give encouragement to unregenerate men to attend upon God in the diligent uſe of means for obtaining the free and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Grace of the Regenerating Spirit, and ſo Converſion thereby; but our Author ſeems to tell Unregenerate men, that all they can do before they be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them, which is got only by Faith in Chriſt, and therefore is in order of nature after Faith in Chriſt; altho they do it with a deſire that they may be Regenerated, and may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a precious holy Faith in Chriſt, and thereby the Holy Spirit of Chriſt. it is all vain labour and an acting of ſin. Now is not this great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for men to wait upon God in the uſe of his appointed means for the obtaining of converting Grace and a new holy heart, to tell them that all they can do in order to that end, is vain labour, and acting of ſin? We hope ſuch men will not believe our Author; but if they do, there is nothing can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them; but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hev ſhould caſt off all uſe of means, and give over all reading hearing, and praying, for why ſhould they trouble themſelves with ſuch Religious Exerciſes, ſince all is an acting of ſin, and loſt labour too. Yet if our Author ſhould intend to ſet up for a <hi>Quietiſt,</hi> the foreſaid Doctrine may be of good uſe to bring in Diſciples to him; for he can tell them holdly (as his manner is) that if they will become <hi>Quietiſts,</hi> he will ſhew them an infallible way wherein they ſhall neither act ſin, nor yet loſe their labour; for if they will become right <hi>Quietiſts,</hi> they ſhall neither act nor labour, but wholly reſt from action and labour; and ſhall not act ſin, nor loſe their labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not act nor labour at all, but wholly reſt from action and labour; and whileſt they are in a ſtate of perfect reſt, without any kind of action or labour at all, Then the Spirit of God ſhall fall upon them, and Regenerate and Convert them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. Objection. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He Objects the Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Inſtitutions writes thus againſt the Papiſts,

                     <hi>They have found out I know not what moral good Works, whereby men are made acceptable to God, before they are ingrafted into Chriſt, as if the Scripture lyed, when it ſaith, they are all in death who have not the Son.</hi> 1 John 5.12. <hi>If they be in death, how ſhould they beget matter of Life? As if it mere of no force, whatſoever is without Faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>As if an evil tree could have good Fruit: But now what place have thoſe moſt Peſtilent Sophiſters left unto Chriſt, where he may put forth and diſplay his Vertue? Why they ſay, that be hath merited for us the firſt Grace, that is, he hath given us occaſion of meriting; And that now it is our part, not to be wanting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93177:87"/>in improving the occaſion offered.</hi> By this paſſage of <hi>Calvin</hi> quoted here more fully than it is in the letter, we ſee more clearly what it is that <hi>Calvin</hi> is there diſputing againſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Popiſh Doctrine of mans meriting his Juſtification and Acceptance with God, as righteous unto eternal Life, by moral good works done by him before he be juſtified, and that is, in their ſenſe before he be initially ſanctified in Regeneration and Converſion; for they perpetually confound theſe two, Juſtification, and Initial Sanctification, on the infuſion of habitual Grace, as ſignifying the ſame thing. This is that which <hi>Calvin</hi> there denies and diſproves. Now this being premiſed, to give light unto the whole matter, We anſwer, That this is nothing to our Authors purpoſe, who brings this paſſage to prove that <hi>Calvin</hi> denyed all preparations and diſpoſitions before Regeneration and Converſion, and conſequently before Juſtification; whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> here denies no ſuch thing; the onely thing that he here denies againſt the Papiſts. Is that a man by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good works done before Juſtification, can merit Juſtification; which we deny, as much as he doth; and that for the ſame reaſon too, becauſe there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are nor can be any moral works before Regeneration and Converſion, that are ſo good as to merit Juſtification, and render a man acceptable unto God. But elſewhere he is ſo far from denying, that he expreſly affirms and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that there are ſome preparations and diſpoſitions in man previous to his Juſtification, as we have plainly ſhewed before: And particularly in his anſwer to <hi>Pighius,</hi> he only denies that a man by his meer natural power without any ſupernatural Grace, can prepare and diſpoſe himſelf for ſpecial ſaving Grace, but at the ſame time he confeſſes and proves, that by the gracious influences of Gods Spirit upon a man, he may be and is prepared and diſpoſed for Juſtification; for though the man be Spiritually dead, yet he hath a natural life and the uſe of his reaſon, and the living and life-giving Spirit of God, can uſe his naturally living, and rational Faculties, to produce ſuch actions as by the Ordination of God ſhall prepare and diſpoſe him to receive the firſt principle of Spiritual Life from the Lord of Life, and upon the exerciſe of that firſt principle of Spiritual Life in acts of Faith and Evangelical Repentance, God for Chriſts ſake alone, pardons his ſins, and gives him a right to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>This is all that we, with <hi>Ames, Twiſs,</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> after the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> hold and maintain concerning diſpoſitions previous to Regeneration and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Calvin</hi> in this paſſage doth not contradict this opinion, but in his other Books maintains it himſelf. If our Author ſhould yet object, that at leaſt one of the places of Scripture which <hi>Calvin</hi> alledges againſt the Papiſts, <hi>to wit, Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin,</hi> will be of force againſt us, and againſt the previous diſpoſitions which we with the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> maintain:</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, That he will find himſelf very much miſtaken, for it is of no force at all againſt us and our opinion: And to ſpeak our minds freely, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all ingenuous men to do, we do not ſee that in it ſelf, it was of any force againſt that opinion of the Papiſts which <hi>Calvin</hi> was there Confuting. Yet to excuſe <hi>Calvins</hi> arguing from it againſt them, it may be ſaid, that he did not ſpeak his own ſenſe therein, but the ſenſe of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who miſtook the true ſenſe of that place of Scripture, as if the word <hi>(Faith)</hi> there, did ſignifie a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, and ſo urged it frequently againſt the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> Now the Popiſh Schoolmen pretended to have a great Veneration for the Authority and Judgment of <hi>Anguſtin;</hi> therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> knowing this, might argue <hi>ad hominem</hi> againſt them, from that place of Scripture taken in <hi>Auguſtins</hi> ſence, and the argument might be of ſome uſe to ſtop their mouths. But otherwiſe the Argument in it ſelf was of no force at all, becauſe it is grounded upon a falſe Interpretation of the word <hi>(Faith)</hi> in that place. And this <hi>Calvin</hi> knew well enough, therefore not only in his Commentary on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſeveral times in his <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> when he ſpeaks his own fence of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93177:87"/>ſin;</hi> he ſays, that by the Word <hi>(Faith)</hi> there is not meant a juſtifying Faith, but a firm perſwaſion of Mind, in oppoſition to doubting that a thing is lawful, and that it may be done without ſin: ſo that according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> the true and genuine ſence of the place is, That whatſoever a man doth without <hi>Faith,</hi> that is, without a firm perſwaſion of mind that he may lawfully do it, whatſoever a man doth with a doubting Conſcience, it is ſin to him who, ſo doth it, though the thing be never ſo lawful in it ſelf. Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds it in the Third Book of his Inſtitutions, Chap. 5. § 10. <hi>Quum nihil operis debeant aggredi fideles, niſi ceriâ Conſcientiâ, ut Paulus praecipit</hi> (Rom. 14.23.) <hi>in oratione potiſſimum requiritur haec certitudo. Since Believers ſhould undertake no work, but with a ſure Conſcience, as</hi> Paul <hi>Commands in</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>This aſſurance is chiefly required in Prayer;</hi> to wit, <hi>that we pray to no perſon,

[Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.] That is, It is ſin, whatſoever it be that is done with a Conſcience that is doubting and uncertain of the will of God. I was not a little grieved when I read</hi> Suarez <hi>accuſing our Divines, that they acted the part of</hi> Sophiſters, <hi>when to prove Justification by Faith alone, they alledge without making a right choice, or putting a difference between one and another, any places of Scriprure where faith is mentioned, although in them there is not the leaſt tittle to be found of Faith related to Christ, and the promiſes of the Goſpel, or that hath reſpect unto abſolution from the guilt of ſin.</hi> This ſhould teach us all to take great care how we quote and apply Scripture to prove our opinions, leaſt by miſapplying Texts, we wreſt the Scripture, grieve Gods Spirit, and harden our Adverſaries in their Erroneous opinions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. <hi>Obj.</hi> Fourthly, He Objects againſt us, <hi>The Seventh Canon of the Sixth Seſſion of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>which Anathematizeth all thoſe who ſay that all works done before Juſtification, howſoever they be done are truly ſins.</hi> We anſwer, that this objection is impertinent, and makes againſt himſelf as well as againſt us.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Let.</hi> p. 16.32.</note> For (1.) He ſays that Faith <hi>is in order of nature before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> as we have proved from ſeveral paſſages in his Letter.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) He ſaith, Pag. 11. <hi>That Faith is a work, that it is a great work, that it is a work of God, yea a work of God which we do, and cannot do too ſoon.</hi> Now we hope he will not ſay that this great work of God, which through Grace we do before Juſtification, and cannot do too ſoon, is an evil work, and is truly ſin: And if it be not an evil work, and truly ſin, then it muſt be a good work, and truly Gracious: And thus we have himſelf holding with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as well as we do, that before Juſtification there is a good work which is not truly ſin, but truly good and Gracious. If he ſay, that Faith doth not juſtifie as a work, that is nothing to the purpoſe, for the Queſtion now is not,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93177:88"/>whether Faith juſtifie as a work, or as an inſtrument, but whether Faith really be a work, an internal work of the Soul, which it may well be, and yet not juſtifie as a work: And he himſelf hath expreſly confeſſed that it is a work, and a great work too, and likewiſe that it is a great work which not only God doth, but which we do through the Grace of God enabling us. But after all, if he be ſo reſolved that he will have nothing common with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but differ from them in all things true or falſe, right or wrong; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold that juſtifying Faith is a good work before Juſtification, that is not truly ſin, he will hold the contrary that tho juſtifying Faith be before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, yet it is not a good work, but an evil work, and is truly ſin: we can ſay nothing to it, he hath his free choice, for any thing that we can do to the contrary; yet we ſhould adviſe him to be wiſer, and not to reject any Truth of the Goſpel, becauſe an adverſary holds and believes it. And that it is a Goſpel-truth, that juſtifying ſaving Faith is a good work, tho it be in order before Juſtification, we doubt not but his own Conſcience knows it and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it. Sure we are that our Conſcience is fully perſwaded of it. And tho' we believe in our hearts and confeſs with our mouths, that juſtifying Faith in the beſt of us is too too little and weak, and that the gradual defect of it is truly ſin, and deſerves the hatred of God; yet are we infallibly ſure that the Grace and gracious Act it ſelf of juſtifying ſaving Faith, ſo far as we have any of it, is truly good and cannot be truly evil and ſin. This we are ſure is a truth, and we believe it, and are reſolved through Grace ſo to do, and never to like it the worſe becauſe the Papiſts believe it, and curſe all thoſe who disbelieve it. We join with them in believing the truth ſo far as they do believe it; but we utterly abhor their curſing of <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> If our Author think fit to Diſſent from us in this matter, we ſhall be ſo far from curſing him, that we ſhall pray God to bleſs him with a better underſtanding of this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, wherein he may be miſtaken. As for the other paſſage which our Author quotes out of the 11th. <hi>Canon, and calls the bellowing of the Beaſt,</hi> We might paſs it over, for it doth not at all concern us, nor the Controverſie that is between the Author of the Letter and us. Yet this we will ſay that he ſeems not to underſtand the Language of that Beaſt of <hi>Trent,</hi> for they confeſs with us, That the Grace whereby we are juſtified, is the favour of God; as plainly appears from what they ſay before the <hi>Canons,</hi> in the 7th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> but they curſe all thoſe who ſay that the Grace whereby we are juſtified is <hi>only the favour of God:</hi> For they hold that we are juſtified <hi>by a two-fold Grace,</hi> the <hi>one External without us,</hi> and it is the mercy and favour of God, which is that that principally moves him to juſtifie us; the <hi>other Internal within us,</hi> the effect of the firſt, and it is the habit of Grace or Charity infuſed into us by the holy Spirit to make us <hi>formally juſt by ſomething Inherent in our ſelves.</hi> Now we do not ſay (any more than they do) that we are juſtified by the favour of God <hi>only,</hi> and excluſively of all other things; for we maintain that we are juſtified by the Grace and Favour of God, and alſo by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. And this is the ground of the Quarrel, this is it for which they Curſe our Author and us both, becauſe we both believe that we are juſtified by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to us, and not by Gods Grace infuſed into us, and inherent in us. And yet we believe this too, <hi>to wit,</hi> that Gods Grace is infuſed into us and inherent in us; only we do not call this Juſtification, but give it another name, and call it Sanctification. Thoſe <hi>Trent Fathers</hi> therefore had no reaſon to be ſo angry with us, and in their Beaſtly wrath to fall a curſing of us.</p>
                  <p>But after all this anger on both ſides, there may be ſome hope that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe Fathers and our Author may be reconciled in time, if the old <hi>Axiom</hi> be true, that <hi>(Quae ſunt eadem in tertio, ſunt eadem inter ſe); They who agree
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93177:88"/>in a Third, agree between themſelves or one with another.</hi> But ſo it is that they agree in a third, <hi>to wit,</hi> in <hi>Bradwardin.</hi> For certain, Papiſts agree with <hi>Bradwardin</hi> in the matter of Juſtification; and they will have good hope that our Author will do ſo too, when they conſider that in the 13th. page of his Letter, he ſaith, <hi>That God gave Bradwardin for a Bleſſing to England.</hi> For ſince he believes that <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin</hi> was a Bleſſing to <hi>England,</hi> the Papiſts cannot but hope that he will be of <hi>Bradwardins</hi> mind in the important point of Juſtification, and if the World would know of what mind <hi>Bradwardin</hi> was in that matter, they may ſee it in his Book, pag. 406 <hi>Conſiteor Deum meum ſicut aeternaliter gratuitô me dilexit, &amp; aeternaliter gratiam Justificatricem tempore placito coram eo, mihi gratis conferre diſpoſuit; ſic tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore placito veniente, gratis inſundere gratiam Juſtificatem mihi injuſto, juſtificare me gratis, lavare injuſtitias meas gratis, ſuſcitare &amp; ſanare me gratis, debitum poenae aeternae dimittere mihi gratis, atque in poenam temporalem vertere ipſam gratis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I confeſs that my God, (as from eternity he freely loved me, and likewiſe from eternity purpoſed freely to give me juſtifying Grace in ſuch time as ſeemed good in his ſight, ſo when the time appointed comes) doth freely infuſe juſtifying Grace into me an unjuſt man, that he doth juſtifie me freely, waſh away my unrighteouſneſs freely, raiſe up and heal me freely, that he doth freely forgive me the debt of eternal puniſhment, and freely change it into temporal puniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. And Pag. 416. <hi>Nec etiam peccator, peccato dimiſſo, ſtatim habet reformatione plenariam ſtatus ſui, ſicut evidenter ſequitur ex predictis; adhuc enim remanet debitor poenae, &amp; ſatisfactionis debitae pro peccato. Nor when ſin is forgiven, hath the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner immediately a full reformation or change of the ſtate of his Soul, as it evidently follows from what hath been ſaid before, for he yet remains a debtor of punistment, or bound to ſuffer puniſhment, and to make the ſatisfaction which he ows for his ſin.</hi> Thus <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> he ſpeaks the true Language of the Beaſt, and makes Juſtification to be by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs, and the pardon of the eternal puniſhment of ſin, with a reſervation of the temporal puniſhment to be yet ſuffered, and of ſatisfaction to be made by our ſelves either in this life, or in Purgatory after this life. In all which there is a perfect agreement between him and the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And let no man think that he muſt needs differ from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks ſo much of Gods freely juſtifying the unrighteous; for it is the firſt Juſtification that he ſo ſpeaks of, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpeaks the ſelf-ſame Language, witneſs their own formal expreſs words in the Eight <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Sixth <hi>Seſſion,
<note place="margin">Concil. <hi>Trident</hi> Seſ. 6. Cap. 8.</note> Perpetuus Eccleſiae Catholicae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus tenuit, ut,</hi> &amp;c. <q>The perpetual conſent of the Catholick Church hath always held, that we are therefore ſaid to be juſtified freely, becauſe none of thoſe things which go before Juſtification, whether Faith or Works, do merit the Grace of Juſtification; for if it be of Grace, then it is not of Works, otherwiſe as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Grace is no more Grace, Rom.</hi> 11.6.</q> Thus the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Whereby it is evident that they and <hi>Bradwardin</hi> are agreed as to the freeneſs of Juſtification, and it is as evident from the Canons that they are agreed about the formal nature of Juſtification, wherein it conſiſts. And as the Papiſts that keep cloſe to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> are agreed with <hi>Bradwardin</hi> in the fundamental point of Juſtification againſt the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians;</hi> ſo they are not without ground of hope that our Author will agree alſo (if he do not already agree) with the profound <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> in that fundamental point of Juſtification againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> becauſe he hath publickly confeſſed it in the 13th. Page of his Letter, <hi>that God gave Bradwardin to be a Bleſſing unto England;</hi> ſurely then (will they ſay among themſelves) this Miniſter will not differ from <hi>Bradwardin</hi> in ſo important a point of Religion, for fear he ſhould prove a Curſe unto <hi>England.</hi> It is not impoſſible, nor it may be improbable, but Papiſts who conſider of the matter, may thus reaſon themſelves into the hopes of a Proſelyte to their Religion. Therefore we will endeavour to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their hopes, and to prevent our Brothers being drawn over to them, by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93177:89"/>means of his admired <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> and this we ſhall do by giving him a further account of the Principles and Practices of that profound Doctor. Thus then he writes in 61 page of his Book, called, <hi>The Cauſe of God. Nos Imagines Christi, Dei, Trinitatis, Angelorum &amp; Sanctorum hominum Adoramus.</hi> 
                     <q>We worſhip the Images of Chriſt, of God, of the Trinity, of Angels, and Holy Men.</q> Again in the ſame page, <hi>Nos Deum propter ſe, &amp; Sanctos, Angelos ejus, &amp; Homines, &amp; ipſorum Imagines</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>adoramus finaliter propter Deum.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <q>We worſhip God for his own ſake, and we worſhip his holy Angels and Men finally for Gods ſake.</q> This <hi>Bradwardin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to have been the Principle and Practice of himſelf and his Church: And in the ſame page he very kindly makes an Apology for the Heathen, and excuſes them from the guilt of damnable Idolatry upon the ſame principle, <q>For (ſays he) it is probable they had ſome knowledge of the true God, and him they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped for his own ſake, <hi>(ſub nomine tamen &amp; Idolo Dei Jovis)</hi> yet under the name and Idol or Image of the God <hi>Jupiter. Et nihilominus praeter ipſum,</hi> &amp;c. And yet beſides him, they worſhipped ſome other Idols, dedicated unto Holy Angels, unto Men and Demons, and in them, and by them they finally wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God.</q> That is the <hi>Pagans</hi> worſhipped God for himſelf, but they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped Idols and Devils for Gods ſake, juſt as the Papiſts worſhip Saints and Angels; and that excuſed them from the guilt of damnable Idolatry, as it doth the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and they therein found acceptance with God: For they knew no better, and did as well as they could, Therefore <hi>(Deus iſta piè &amp; diſcretè reſpiciens, ignorantiae &amp; ſimplicitati eorum pepercit, ſinceram verô dilectionem, ſanctam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionem, &amp; benevolam voluntatem acceptavit: Hoc autem conſonum videtur rationi, non enim videtur quod juſtiſſimus atque piiſſimus plus requirat ab homine quam accepit, &amp; quam ſit in hominis poteſtate, imò quod illud acceptet ſi intentione debitâ offeratur.)</hi> 
                     <q>God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe things mercifully and diſcreetly ſpared their ignorance and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, but he accepted the ſincere love, the holy intention, and kind will of thoſe worſhippers of Demons. And this ſeems agreeable to reaſon that it ſhould be ſo, for it is not likely that the moſt juſt and merciful God doth require more of a man than he hath received, and more than is in a mans power; yea it is rather probable that God accepts of what a man is able do, if it be offered with a due Intention.</q> Thus the profound Doctor, and by this let all <hi>Calviniſts</hi> judge, and let the Conſcience of our Author judge, how well that Doctor hath confuted the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and how greatly <hi>England</hi> is bleſſed with ſuch a Confuter.</p>
                  <p>One touch more, and we have done with him. In the 26th Chapter of his firſt Book of the Cauſe of God againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> he maintains with all his might, that <hi>nothing is evil of it ſelf,</hi> but by Accident, <hi>no not the wickedeſt thing that a Man doth or can do;</hi> and therefore that the moſt horrid wickedneſs a Man can commit, in other circumſtances may ceaſe to be Evil, and be no Sin to him that commits it: To prove this, he makes ſeveral Suppoſitions. As, (1.) in <hi>Pag.</hi> 256. He puts this Caſe (which he ſays is poſſible) <hi>That a ſimple Man without any foregoing fault of his, is ſo deluded by the Devil</hi> (<hi>whom he calls</hi> Behemoth, <hi>the moſt cunning of all Sophiſters</hi>) <hi>that he is made to believe that unleſs he blaſpheme or hate God, he ſhall neceſſarily and unavoidably commit more Sin, than that blaſphemy or hatred of Gods amounts unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſays our profound Doctor in this Caſe, <hi>(Iſte ſimplex ſecundum judicium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſmae rationis, tenetur blaſphemare Deum, vel odire, ne alias incidat in majus peccatum, quoniam ſecundum communem animi conceptionem, de duchus malis, minus malum eſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum, cujus cauſa eſt, quia in bonis est è contrario, ſcilicet quod majus eſt magis eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum.) That ſimple Man according to the Judgment of the moſt right Reaſon, is bound to blaſpheme God, or to hate him, leſt otherwiſe, (as Satan tells him) he fall into a greater Sin, for according to the common Notion of Mans Mind, of two Evils the leaſt is to be choſen, the Reaſon whereof is this, that on the contrary, of things that are good, the greateſt is to be choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe Premiſes he concludes, that to blaſpheme or hate God, <hi>is not of it ſelf neceſſarily and unalterably evil and ſinful;</hi> becauſe there may happen a Caſe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93177:89"/>wherein a ſimple Man, deluded by the Devil, is <hi>bound to blaſpheme or hate God,</hi> and that according to the Judgment of Reaſon, of Right Reaſon, yea of the moſt Right Reaſon, and that is, of the beſt Reaſon in the World. (2.) In the ſame Page he puts another like Caſe, which he ſaith, <hi>Is poſſible alſo without any foregoing fault of the Perſon concerned. Suppoſe a ſimple Man ſwears to be entirely obedient to his Prelate or Superior in all things; then that Prelate, or the Devil transformed into him, commands the ſimple Man to hate or blaſpheme God.</hi> The Poor Man is certainly caught in a ſnare, but how ſhall he get out? why according to <hi>Bradwardin, It is poſſible for him to get out ſafe by blaſpheming or hating God in Obedience to his Superiour, and out of Conſcience of his Oath; for that is the leaſt Evil of the two, and ſo comparatively is no Evil at all; becauſe to blaſpheme or hate God is but one Sin, and that againſt God only,</hi> (multumque excuſatum per praeceptum Praelati) <hi>and it is much excuſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Superiour; whereas he believes, that in this Caſe not to obey, is a greater Sin, becauſe</hi> (1.) <hi>It is againſt his Superiour.</hi> (2.) <hi>It is alſo againſt God, whoſe Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent his Superiour is.</hi> (3.) <hi>It is a Violation and breach of his Oath and Vow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is another of his Demonſtrations, that blaſphemy and hatred of God, is not of it ſelf and unalterably Evil, becauſe here is a poſſible Caſe wherein it ceaſes to be Evil, and an Honeſt Man outwitted by a Knave may do it without Sin. In the next Page, he hath other Arguments of the like Nature to prove the ſame Poſition; but we are unwilling to have any thing more to do with him, for he <hi>next ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Satan to be transformed into Chriſt himſelf, and in that likeneſs to act his part ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly and effectually as to diſcharge a Man from his Duty to God, and oblige him in Conſcience to commit the foreſaid Wickedneſs for a time, for fear of being neceſſitated to do it for ever, and to all Eternity.</hi> Now upon the whole, we refer it to all Men of common ſenſe, who have any true fear of God, and love to Chriſt and pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to judge whether this be bleſt or curſed Doctrine, and whether <hi>England</hi> be beholding to that Man who commends ſuch Books to young Miniſters?</p>
                  <p>But though we think the Nation, and young Miniſters in it are little beholding to him on that account; yet we hope better things of him than that he will ever become a Proſylite to the Popiſh Religion, or that for the ſake of <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> he will ever embrace the foreſaid Doctrines, which many Papiſts themſelves abhor.</p>
                  <p>It may be he will ſay, that this <hi>Bradwardin</hi> was an Engliſh Man, that lived long ſince, and he did not ken him well; but if he had ken'd him or his Book either, he would never have ſo commended him. And if he be ingenuous to ſay ſo, we readlly admit the excuſe, for we believe it to be very true, and find that in more things than that one, he writes of what he doth not underſtand, and that too with an Air of Confidence that deſerves a rebuke. And withall, we adviſe him for the future to forbear talking of old Authors, and commending their Books to Miniſters, for he ſeems not to be much acquainted with that kind of Learning.</p>
                  <p>As he writes in his Letter, <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. That a great many Young Students have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with ſtudying Engliſh Authors, ſo we think it had not been ill for him, if he had contented himſelf with ſtudying ſuch <hi>Scots</hi> Authors, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh too, as never trod in the By-paths of <hi>Bradwardin, Saltmarſh</hi> or <hi>Criſp.</hi> We have mentioned ſome of that ſort already, to whom we will now adde a few more; and firſt we commend to our Authors Conſideration, a Paſſage or two of a Reverend, Learned and Modeſt <hi>Scots</hi> Divine, whom he ſhould Ken better than the old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman <hi>Bradwardin.</hi> It is Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> once Profeſſour of Divinity in the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who in his <hi>Therapeutica Sacra,</hi> writes thus,

                     <q>[Together with theſe external Means (mentioned before) ſerving for drawing on the Covenant, and going on in it, the common Operations of God do concur; common to all the called both Elect and Reprobate, and Gifts common to both are beſtowed, ſuch as Illumination, Moral Perſwaſion, Hiſtorical, Dogmatical and Temporary Faith, Moral Change of Affections, and ſome ſort of external Amendment of their

                  </p>
                  <p>Here are Preparations and Diſpoſitions before either Regeneration or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plainly aſſerted by <hi>Dickſon;</hi> then <hi>pag.</hi> 99. he enters upon a large Diſcourſe, concerning the Condition of the Covenant; and he ſays,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That in receiving of grown Perſons into Covenant, There are three Conditions to be obſerved and diſtinguiſhed one from another. (1.) The Condition of the Perſon deſiring to be in Covenant with God for Reconciliation and Grace through Chriſt. (2.) The Condition upon which he is entered into Covenant. (3.) The Condition required of him for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of his ſincere Covenanting. And <hi>Pag.</hi> 100. He ſays all theſe three are expreſſed by Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They that labour and are heavy laden,</hi> are they whom Chriſt calleth unto a Covenant, and fellowſhip of his Grace; this that he calls the Condition of the Perſon, is the ſame thing with that which we call the Diſpoſition or Qualification of the Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He propounds the Condition of the Covenant, to wit, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, or come unto him, that in him they may find full relief from Sin and Miſery, and in him full Righteouſneſs and Felicity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He requires of them who do embrace him by Faith, and ſo have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Condition of the Covenant, that they give evidence of their Faith in him, by taking his Yoke upon them. <hi>Take my Yoke upon you,</hi> ſaith he. Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> calls this, The third Condition, and ſays a little before, that it is the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters up giving of himſelf to Chriſts Government and Obedience of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This brings to our remembrance, a Paſſage in the Catechiſm, publiſhed by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of <hi>Marpurgh</hi> in the Year 1606. <hi>Fidem ſufficere ad apprehendendam ſalutem, non autem ad cam conſervandam: ſed amplius requiri vitae emendationem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That Faith is ſufficient for the firſt apprehending or receiving of Salvation; but not for the conſerving or continuing of it; but there is moreover required Amendment of Life.</p>
                     <p>It reminds us alſo, of what we read in the fourth <hi>Tome</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Claudes</hi> Poſthumous Work, in the very entrance of his Treatiſe of Juſtification, <hi>Pag.</hi> 75. That there are Diſpoſitions previous unto Juſtification; and that there are Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which God neceſſarily ſuppoſes in Man, and which ought to be found actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in him. And then that there are Conditions, which God impoſes upon a Man, when he juſtifies him, to the end that he may obſerve them for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>he diſtinguiſhes,</hi> in his Hiſtorical Defence of the Reformation, <hi>Part</hi> 2. Chap. 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 218. of the Engliſh Tranſlation, Between the Condition ſuppoſed to Juſtification, which is Faith and Repentance; and the Condition impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the Lord, when he juſtifies us, which is, that for the time to come, we live Holily according to the Laws which he has given us.</p>

This our Author will grant, as we perceive by his Letter. But Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> ſpends two Sermons more to prove, That this cannot be without the teachings of God in the way of Spiritual Illumination.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>—And if this were not ſo, but as our Author would have it, it would follow unavoidably that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> in their Books about the Souls Preparation for Chriſt, and the ſeveral ſteps of it, <hi>viz. Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Compunction, Humiliation, &amp;c.</hi> wrote very great impertinencies, and, which is worſe, did a great deal of hurt to the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>For our parts, ſince we are ſaid to be <hi>Middle-way-men,</hi> we think that to anſwer that Character that is given of us, we ought to avoid all extremes as well in this, as in other matters; and therefore we ſay, that no more of the foreſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Diſpoſitions, is ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary than what makes the Soul, (1.) See its abſolute need of Chriſt, and its being utterly loſt and undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. (2.) What makes it ſee and believe that there is abundant help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for loſt Sinners in Chriſt, that he is an Alſufficient Saviour, and the only Alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Saviour, able and willing to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto him, and unto God by him, in the way preſcribed in the Goſpel. (3.) What makes them thereupon deſirous to have him, and in ſome ſort willing to receive him in all his Offices as he is offered, deſirous to have him, and willing to receive him, and his Benefits with him upon his own Terms, the Terms held forth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Of them who by the preventing Grace of the Holy Spirit are thus diſpoſed, there is no more required to be done by them in a way of Preparation for Chriſt, but they may and ought immediately to receive him into their Hearts by Faith, and Confidently truſt him with their Souls and Bodies, with their whole Perſon, to be ſaved by him in the way agreed upon between God and Him; and may be firmly and fully perſwaded that if they do ſo through Grace, they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſcarry under the hand of ſuch a Saviour and Phyſitian of Souls.</p>
                  <p>Thus we Preach, and we know none can have juſt cauſe to ſay, that this is a new Goſpel, and we hope none will any more ſay ſo. We are ſure this uſed not to be accounted a new Goſpel heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> nor is it ſo accounted at <hi>Geneva;</hi>

                     <p>And they are either External, which may be done by a Man, or are in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſuch as to go unto the Church, to hear the Word, and the like; or they are Internal, which are excited by Grace, even in the Hearts of the unconverted, ſuch as the Reception and Apprehenſion of the Word Preached, Knowledge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, ſome Senſe of Sin, Fear of Puniſhment, and ſome kind of Deſire of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of his Ridiculous Way of Converting an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AND firſt we acknowledge to our Authors Praiſe, that he made a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and from the 17th line of the 15th page to the beginning of the 16th. he Diſcourſes well enough, and ſhews how indiſpenſibly neceſſary it is that a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner believe on Chriſt, and what warrant he hath from the Command, as alſo what encouragement from the Conditional Promiſe of God in the Goſpel, to believe on Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
            <p>But we cannot ſay, that as he made a good beginning, ſo he continues till he have made a good end; for he gives ſeveral miſerable Anſwers to the Queſtions, which he makes the Unbeliever to put unto the Miniſter, who is perſwading him to believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He makes the Unbeliever to ask the Miniſter, <hi>What it is to believe on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt?</hi> Whereunto he Anſwers, <hi>That be finds no ſuch Queſtion in the Word of God, but that all, both Believers and Unbelievers, the Diſciples, and the Enemies of Chriſt, did ſome way underſtand the Notion of it:</hi> And this he endeavours to prove, becauſe it was commonly reported by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>That Faith in Chriſt, is a believing that the Man Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth <hi>is the Son of God, the Meſſiah, and Saviour of the World, ſo as to receive and look for Salvation in his Name;</hi> and this common report was known by all that heard it.</p>
            <p>This is no ſatisfactory Anſwer, for the Unbeliever may eaſily reply (1ſt.) That though in the Scriptures, there be no ſuch Queſtion in <hi>ſo many expreſs formal Words,</hi> yet there is ſufficient <hi>ground</hi> in and from the Scripture for a Man to ask ſuch a Queſtion, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of ſeveral ſorts of Faith, of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical, Temporary, and miraculous Faith; and of a ſaving juſtifying Faith: Of a Faith, that is common to unconverted Wicked Men and Devils, and of a Faith that is proper and peculiar to Gods Elect.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:93177:91"/>
            <p>Theſe Faiths are of different natures, and therefore one of them muſt have ſomething that another hath not, and each of them muſt have that whereby they are conſtituted in themſelves and diſtinguiſhed from one another. And this being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, that the man be not deceived to his ruin, he hath great reaſon to put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Queſtion, and ſhould be commended for asking (if he do it ſeriouſly), <hi>What it is to believe on Chriſt?</hi> To believe in him ſo as he ought to do, ſo as may be to Gods Glory, and his own Spiritual and Eternal Good? (2.) He may reply, that if there were no ground for ſuch a Queſtion, why did the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> put that ſame Queſtion in the <hi>Shorter Catechiſm,</hi> which they compoſed for the uſe of Children? Had they no warrant from Scripture for putting ſuch a Queſtion? Or doth the Scripture only warrant Miniſters, to put Queſtions to the People; but not warrant the people to put Queſtions to the Miniſters?</p>
            <p>Again he may ſay, that if there were no ground for putting ſuch a queſtion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Art.</hi> 1, 2.</note> why did the ſame Aſſembly in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> give ſuch a large Deſcription of Faith? was it not that they and all who own their Confeſſion, might be readily furniſhed with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch a queſtion, which they knew was expedient to be asked, (ſince there are ſeveral ſorts of Faith in Chriſt, and ſo much Hypocritical counterfeit Faith in the World and in the Church), and neceſſary to be wiſely and judiciouſly anſwered, that people may underſtand what kind of Faith it is that they are chiefly to ſeek after and get; and if they have it, that they may know it to their comfort; and may bleſs God for it, and give him the glory of it.</p>
            <p>(3dly.) The Unbeliever may reply <q>That it doth not follow that becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles commonly reported that Faith is a believing that Jeſus is the Son of God, the Meſſias and Saviour of the World, ſo as to receive and look for Salvation in his Name: Therefore the thing Reported was known by all that heard the report, and they did all ſome way underſtand the notion of it.</q> For we read in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32, 33. That Chriſt told his own Apoſtles as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any thing can be expreſſed in words, that he would go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that there he ſhould be moſt cruelly and ſhamefully put to death, and riſe again the third day: And yet in the very next verſe 34. It is ſaid, <hi>They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood none of theſe things: And this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken.</hi> If Chriſts own Apoſtles remained ignorant of thoſe great Truths concerning himſelf, which he had newly told them with as great plainneſs as human Speech is capable of, we may well ſuppoſe that Chriſts E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies (at leaſt many of them) underſtood nothing at all of the things that were reported concerning Jeſus his being the Chriſt and Saviour of the World, and concerning believing on him as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He may reply, <q>That ſuppoſe it were true (which can never be proved) That all Chriſts Enemies knew the common report concerning Faith in him, ſo as ſome way to underſtand the notion of Faith.</q> Yet that is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: for there is a wrong way of underſtanding a thing, as well as a right way, ſo that they might ſome way underſtand it, and yet that ſome way might be the wrong way. Now what is that to the purpoſe, when one asks you this Queſtion, <hi>What is it to believe on Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> To tell him that all Men do ſome way underſtand what it is: for ſome, <hi>to wit,</hi> Chriſts Friends underſtand it the right way, and others, <hi>to wit,</hi> his Enemies underſtand it the wrong way?</p>
            <p>If our Author ſhould ſay that he meant not ſo, that all men did underſtand it ſome way, that is, <hi>either the right or the wrong way;</hi> he would make himſelf yet more ridiculous: For the Unbeliever would in all probability deſire him to name and ſhew any one way of underſtanding a thing which is <hi>neither the right way nor the wrong way</hi> of underſtanding it. And all men of ſenſe would laugh at him, if he ſhould in earneſt go about to convince an Unbeliever, that there is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93177:92"/>a way of underſtanding what Faith is, which is neither the right way, nor the wrong way. If laſtly our Author ſhould tell the Unbeliever, That in ſaying, <hi>all men did ſome way underſtand what Faith in Chriſt is;</hi> his meaning is that all men underſtood it the right way: The Unbeliever would reply upon him, that if that was his meaning, then his meaning muſt needs be falſe, becauſe he himſelf in the 20th. Page of his Letter affirmeth that <q>All the ignorant people amongſt Chriſtians, and amongſt Chriſtians too of the Reformed Churches in <hi>England,</hi> have no knowledg of Faith in Chriſt, except by Faith you underſtand a dream of being ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, though they know nothing of him, or of his way of ſaving Men, nor of the way of being ſaved by him.</q> Now if all the Ignorant People amongſt us know nothing of Faith in Chriſt, in the right way, unleſs the <hi>dreaming way</hi> be the right way, how can our Author prove that all the Unbelievers amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> (amongſt whom Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached) whereof many were groſly ignorant, did underſtand aright what Faith in Chriſt is? Do our ignorant people know nothing of Chriſt, nor of his way of ſaving men? and did not the ignorant <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> know as little? Eſpecially if it be conſidered that the notion which the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had of the Meſſias, was that he ſhould be a great and glorious Temporal Prince and Earthly King, who by the material Sword ſhould Conquer and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all their other viſible Enemies on Earth; and ſhould ſave their Nation with a Temporal Salvation: But as for Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation in another World, many of them, <hi>to wit,</hi> the whole Sect of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> looked upon it as a Dream of Fancyful men; but for their parts they expected no ſuch thing either from the Meſſias or from God himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8.</p>
            <p>No man in his right ſenſes who conſiders theſe things, can deliberately and ſeriouſly think that all the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> who heard the common report concerning <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> had any righter and better underſtanding concerning Faith in him, and Salvation by him, than the generality of ignorant People amongſt us have. Chriſt and his Apoſtles have put this matter paſt all doubt and controverſie with all that do themſelves truly believe in Chriſt. For thus Chriſt prayed for many of them; <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father forgive them for they know not what they do. Peter</hi> alſo confeſſeth to themſelves that it was through <hi>ignorance</hi> that they Crncified Chriſt; <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17. And <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8. ſaith <hi>That had they known the hidden Wiſdom of God in a miſtery, they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Whence it is evident that either they had no notion of Faith in Chriſt, and of Salvation by him, or if they had any at all, it was a wrong and falſe notion. And to tell a Man who asks us, what it is to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, That even the Enemies of Chriſt ſome way under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what it is, becauſe they had ſome wrong and falſe notion of it, is both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and ridiculous; and is ſuch an anſwer as is more apt to make an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer laugh at Chriſts Miniſters, and harden and confirm him in his Unbelief, than to move him unto ſeriouſneſs, and to perſwade him to believe. So much for the Unbelievers firſt pertinent Queſtion, and our Authors impertinent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it. We paſs on to the other queſtions and anſwers, as he hath ſet them down in the 16 and 17th. pages of his Letter.</p>
            <p>Queſt. (2.) Unbeliever. <hi>What is a Man to believe,</hi> to wit, <hi>at firſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miniſters Anſwer.</hi> 
               <q>He is not called to believe that he is in Chaiſt, and that his ſins are pardoned, and he a juſtified man, but he is to believe Gods Record concerning Chriſt;</q> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. And this Record is, that God giveth, that is, <hi>offereth to us eternal life in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and that all who with the heart, believe this Report, and reſt their Souls on theſe glad tidings, ſhall be ſaved</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10, 11. <hi>And thus he is to believe that he may be juſtified;</hi> Gal. 2.16.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer is in it ſelf true and good, but in and from the mouth of our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93177:92"/>Author it hath no force at all to ſatisfie the Conſcience of an Unbeliever, who ſeriouſly ſeeks Information and Satisfaction as to what he is <hi>at firſt</hi> to believe; becauſe if he attentively read and conſider our Authors Letter, he will ſee cauſe to doubt whether in this matter he really believes himſelf: Becauſe in his Appendix pag. 35. He moſt highly commends and approves Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> late Book, and in the 7th. page of his Letter, he ſaith expeſly that Mr. <hi>Walter Marſhal,</hi> in his Excellent Book lately publiſhed, hath largely opened this matter, and the true controverfie of this day. Now it is true Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> throughout his 10th. Direction from page 168 to page 193, inſiſts much upon the opening of this matter, but he doth it ſo, that quite contrary to the anſwer which our Author hath now given to the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Queſtion, he maintians, <q>That aſſurance that Chriſt is ours, that our ſins are now forgiven, and we are now juſtified Men, is Eſſential to the very firſt Act of juſtifying Faith, whereby we firſt receive Chriſt, and rely on him for Juſtification and Salvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He diſtinguiſheth indeed as our Author doth between the Direct and Reflex Act of Faith, and two things he hath there concerning the <hi>Reflex</hi> Act.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He doubts whether it be properly an Act of Faith at all, and rather thinks that it is an Act of Spiritual ſenſe and feeling of what is within our ſelves; Page 172.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He poſitively affirms that <hi>the aſſurance we get by the Reflex Act of Faith,</hi> or of Spiritual ſenſe, comes after Juſtification, and is not of the Eſſence of that Faith whereby we are juſtified and ſaved, and that many precious Saints are without it, and ſubject to many doubts that are contrary to it, ſo that they may <hi>not know at all</hi> that it ſhall go well with them at the day of Judgment; 10th. <hi>Direction.</hi> Page 172, 173.</p>
            <p>Then for the Direct Act of Faith, he ſaith, (and ſo doth our Author after him) that it is two-fold. The (1ſt.) Direct Act of Faith is that whereby we</p>
            <q>
               <p>Believe the Truth of the Goſpel. The (2d.) Is that whereby we believe on Chriſt, as promiſed freely to us in the Goſpel for our Salvation. By the (1st.) Act, Faith receiveth the means wherein Chriſt is conveyed to us. By the (2d.) It receiveth Chriſt himſelf and his Salvation in the means.—And both theſe Acts muſt be performed heartily with an unfeigned Love to the Truth, and a deſire of Chriſt and his Salvation above all things: This is our Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which is neceſſary for our eating and drinking Chriſt, the food of Life, as a natural Appetitite is for bodily nouriſhment.—We muſt receive the love of the Truth, by reliſhing the goodneſs and excellency of it—and this love muſt be to every part of Chriſts Salvation, to Holineſs, as well as to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenneſs of ſins.—The former of theſe Acts doth not immediately unite to Chriſt, becauſe it is terminated only on the means of conveyance, the Goſpel; yet it is a ſaving Act, if it be rightly performed, becauſe it inclineth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Soul to the latter Act, whereby Chriſt himſelf is immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the heart. He that believeth the Goſpel with hearty love and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the moſt excellent Truth, will certainly with the like heartineſs believe on Chriſt for his Salvation; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the Scripture ſaving Faith is ſometimes deſcribed by the former of theſe Acts, as if it were a meer believing the Goſpel: Sometimes by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a believing on Chriſt, or in Chriſt; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1, 13.— Then he ſaith that This Second Principal Act of Faith in Chriſt, includeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that it is the ſame thing with truſting in God. 4th. <hi>Direction,</hi> page 61, 62, 63. And elſewhere, he affirms that the Direct Acts of Faith include love.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now touching theſe Direct Acts of Faith, we acknowledge that there is an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Eſſential to the firſt of them whereby we believe the promiſes of the Goſpel; and that aſſurance is two fold, <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Conditional.</hi> Firſt, By our Faith of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93177:93"/>the Goſpel we are <hi>Abſolutely ſure</hi> that God according to his promiſe doth give Chriſt, and Juſtification and Salvation through him unto all true penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. (2.) By our Faith of the Goſpel we are <hi>Conditionally ſure,</hi> that if we are true penitent Believers, God according to his promiſe doth give Chriſt; and Juſtification and Salvation through him unto us in particular. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes of the Goſpel, being general to all penitent Believers, they comprehend all the Particulars of the ſame kind; and therefore if we believe with an abſolute aſſurance that God juſtifies and ſaves through Chriſt, all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believers, we muſt by neceſſary conſequence believe at the ſame time with a conditional aſſurance that God juſtifies and will ſave us through Chriſt, if we be true penitent Believers. This conditional aſſurance with reſpect to our ſelves, upon ſuppoſition of our being true penitent Believers, is neceſſarily included in the former abſolute Aſſurance, that God for Chriſts ſake, juſtifies and ſaves all true penitent Believers.</p>
            <p>Then for the ſecond Act of juſtifying Faith, whereby we believe on Chriſt himſelf with fiducial conſent, according to the Goſpel, we freely grant that it alſo is accompanied with aſſurance; but (mark it) <hi>not with an aſſurance that is Eſſential to it ſelf,</hi> and Eſſentially included in it ſelf, but with the <hi>aſſurance,</hi> the double aſſurance of the <hi>firſt aſſenting Act,</hi> which though it go before, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues and accompanies the ſecond Act of fiducial conſent. And for this reaſon we approve of that aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> in the 179 page of his Book, <q>That believing on Chriſt for Salvation as freely promiſed to us, muſt needs include a dependance on Chriſt, with a perſwaſion that Salvation ſhall be freely given, as it is freely promiſed to us.</q> Thus he. And we ſubſume, But it is freely promiſed to us <hi>only on Condition</hi> that we through Grace are true penitent Believers, as we before proved at large. Therefore the perſwaſion or aſſurance of it, which accompanies our dependance on Chriſt by the Second Act of Faith, is a <hi>Conditional perſwaſion or aſſurance,</hi> as it concerns our ſelves and our own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in particular. Yet afterwards when by Reflex Acts of Faith and ſelf Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we clearly perceive (through the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit) that we are indeed true penitent Believers, then our aſſurance becomes abſolute, and we are abſolutely perſwaded and aſſured that Chriſt is ours, and that God is our God in Chriſt, and that through Chriſt we are juſtified and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This is all <hi>the aſſurance</hi> that the Scriptures hold forth to us as attainable in this life by the ordinary aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit and Grace, and if any good Men have at any time by extraordinary favour and priviledge attained to any other or more aſſurance; they had beſt keep it to themſelves, and be very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under it, and thankful to God for it; and they ſhould not affirm it to be <hi>Abſolutely and Eſſentially neceſſary to the Fiducially Conſenting Act of juſtifying ſaving Faith,</hi> and by that means condemn all who have not <hi>that ſort of aſſurance,</hi> as having yet no juſtifying ſaving Faith, but as being ſtill in a ſtate of nature, and Children of Wrath, and of the Devil.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to ſhew (if we had time and room for it here) that all the reaſons, Scriptures and Examples which Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> brings to prove, <hi>That an abſolute aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (that Christ is now ours, that our ſins are now pardoned, that we are juſtified, and ſhall be eternally ſaved)</hi> is abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſary to the direct Act of juſtifying Faith, whereby we firſt receive Chriſt and truſt on him for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation; prove no ſuch thing: The utmoſt that they prove, is that the foreſaid aſſurances which we willingly admit, are partly antecedent to, and concomitant with, and partly conſequent upon the Direct Act of Faith, whereby we receive Chriſt with ſiducial conſent, that through him we may be juſtified and ſaved.</p>
            <p>But there is not one of them that proves, that an <hi>abſolute Aſſurance that Chriſt for the preſent is ours, and that we are now juſtified and in the State of Salvation;</hi> is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93177:93"/>neceſſary unto, and included in the direct Act of juſtifying Faith. And whereas it is Confidently ſaid, that all our Reformed Divines were for this ſort of Aſſurance as eſſential to the direct Act of that Faith whereby we are firſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we Anſwer, That it is indeed ſaid with <hi>Confidence enough,</hi> but it is a <hi>vain ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs Confidence,</hi> for though <hi>ſome</hi> might be of that falſe Opinion, yet it is notoriouſly falſe that <hi>all</hi> were; we ſhall at preſent give one conſiderable inſtance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and our Inſtance ſhall be in Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> the Author of the Book of Martyrs,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Chriſte gratis Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficante,</hi> p. 246, 247.</note> who in his Book of Juſtification written againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, ſays expreſly, [<hi>Sic mea feri ratio ut exiſtimem,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Such is my Judgment, that I think this Confident Perſwaſion of Mercy, and Aſſurance of the Promiſed Salvation, is not the thing which properly and abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Sin, and juſtifies us before God; but that there is ſome other thing propoſed in the Goſpel, which muſt ſome way in Order of Nature go before this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and juſtifie us before God; for Faith in the Perſon of the Son neceſſarily goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which Faith in the Perſon of the Son, first reconciles us to God. Afterward a confident or ſure perſwaſion of most certain mercy, follows this Faith:</hi> Concerning which Mercy, <hi>none of thoſe who believe in Chriſt, can juſtly doubt.</hi> By this and more that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, it is clear as the Light, that he did not believe that an <hi>abſolute Aſſurance of our being now pardoned, juſtified</hi> and reconciled to God is included in, and eſſential to the direct Act of Faith, whereby we are juſtified in the ſight of God; but on the contrary he held that the direct Act of Faith in the Perſon of the Son of God whereby we are juſtified, <hi>goes before</hi> the ſaid Aſſurance, and <hi>Aſſurance follows after</hi> it; which is what we believe, and ſo doth <hi>our Author</hi> with us; for he tells the Unbeliever, That <hi>a Man is not called to believe that he is in Chriſt.</hi> Mark the Expreſſion, he doth not only ſay, [A Man is not called to believe, that he <hi>was</hi> in Chriſt before he believed.] For that <hi>Marſhal</hi> and all but <hi>Antinomians</hi> do ſay; but he ſays, that a Man is not called to believe that he <hi>is</hi> in Chriſt (<hi>pro praeſenti) for this preſent,</hi> that his Sins are <hi>now</hi> pardoned, and he <hi>now</hi> a juſtified Man; but he is called to believe the Goſpel Record, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt according to the Record, that is, he is to believe that he <hi>may be</hi> juſtified, and not that <hi>he is</hi> juſtified. But now <hi>Marſhal,</hi> unto whom our Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals for the opening of this matter, hath ſo <hi>opened</hi> it, that he <hi>hath ſhut it</hi> up in darkneſs, Confuſion and Self-contradiction, as it were no difficult task to demonſtrate. He maintains confidently, (1.) That Aſſurance of our being <hi>now</hi> juſtified, and of the Pardon of our Sins, is neceſſarily and eſſentially included in the direct Act of juſtifying Faith. <hi>Pag.</hi> 169, 170, 171.172, 173, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He maintains, That <hi>all the Reprobate,</hi> who live in the viſible Church, are by God ſtrictly obliged under Pain of Eternal Damnation to believe with the foreſaid juſtifying Faith and abſolute Aſſurance, which is eſſential to it, that <hi>they are now juſtified, and that their Sins are now pardoned,</hi> though it be then and always falſe that they are juſtified, and their Sins pardoned, <hi>Pag.</hi> 202.204.</p>
            <p>Yet he ſaith, that this is but the <hi>Appearance</hi> of a great Abſurdity, <hi>Pag.</hi> 171. whereby he gives us to underſtand either, (1.) That it is no <hi>real</hi> Abſurdity to hold that <hi>God obliges Men under pain of Eternal Damnation to believe aſſuredly, that a falſhood is truth, and that they who are not pardoned, are pardoned.</hi> Or (2.)

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Author</hi> ſometimes ſeems to be wiſer than to believe ſuch vain Fancies; and yet at other times he appears to be deeply in love with them, as when he moſt highly commends Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> Book (in which we deny not but there are good things), as the moſt Soveraign Antidote againſt the Poyſon of the new Divinity; and ſays, that he hath largely opened this matter.</p>
            <p>For our parts, we are willing to impute this to his not having Attentively read that Book, and ſo to his not knowing, that Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> did manifeſtly contradict and diſpute againſt his Opinion, as a Limb or Joint of the new Divinity: But we are afraid <hi>his unbeliever</hi> will be really ſcandalized at his telling him, that he is not called at the firſt to believe <hi>that he is now</hi> in Chriſt, that his Sins <hi>are</hi> pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he <hi>is now a juſtified Man;</hi> though in the ſame Letter he ſends him to <hi>Marſhals</hi> Book for Information and Direction in this very matter, and <hi>it</hi> tells him the quite contrary, and confidently maintains that an Unbeliever is called and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt upon Pain of Eternal Damnation to <hi>believe with abſolute Aſſurance by the direct Act of Faith in Christ, that he is now in Christ, his Sins pardoned and he a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This we are afraid, will tempt <hi>his Unbeliever</hi> to ſay, Either, Sir, <hi>you believe</hi> this of <hi>Marſhal</hi> or <hi>not;</hi> if you do <hi>not</hi> believe it, why do you commend his Book to me, as that which will give me beſt Direction in this matter, and preſerve my Soul from being poyſoned with the new Divinity? But if you <hi>do believe</hi> him, why do you <hi>contradict</hi> him, he telling me one thing, and you telling me the quite contrary, yea the contradictory thereof? Why do you alſo join with the <hi>new</hi> Divines againſt him or his Book, and go about to <hi>poyſon my Soul with the new Divinity,</hi> in the great Point of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> its not being eſſential to the <hi>direct</hi> Act of juſtifying Faith, whereas the contrary Opinion of <hi>Marſhal</hi> which you deny, was the <hi>great Engine wherewith our first Reformers battered down the Walls of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>our Author</hi> by his way of Writing is more like to hinder men from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to harden them in their unbelief, than to be inſtrumental in Converting them from unbelief to Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Unbeliever, <hi>This believing is hard?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſter, <hi>This is a good doubt, but eaſily reſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here again, the Miniſter makes himſelf <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and expoſes himſelf to the ſcorn and contempt of the Unbeliever; for the Unbeliever makes no doubt of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but poſitively afferts that this believing is <hi>hard,</hi> as being firmly perſwaded in his Mind (without the leaſt Heſitation or Doubt) that this believing is hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and when the Miniſter has heard him ſay, yea has put the Words in his Mouth, and made him to ſay <hi>poſitively (without doubting)</hi> that this believing is hard; then he anſwers him, and ſays this is <hi>a good doubt</hi> and eaſily reſolved, and the plain Engliſh of that is, that <hi>no doubt but a Poſitive Affirmation, is a good doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing for once with the Miniſter that <hi>no doubt</hi> is a doubt, yet how doth he make it appear that it is <hi>a good</hi> doubt? for there are bad doubts as well as good doubts, and why may not this be a bad doubt, rather than a good doubt? Yes ſaith the Miniſter, I prove it and make it appear thus, that it is not a bad,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93177:94"/>but a good doubt; becauſe it beſpeaks <hi>a man deeply humbled.</hi> Rar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly proved! But why may it not as well beſpeak a man to be <hi>deeply hardened</hi> in unbelief, and highly liſted up in pride? For were not the <hi>Capernaites</hi> deeply hardned in unbelief, and yet when they heard Chriſt himſelf with his own Bleſſed mouth preaching to them of the great neceſſity and uſefulneſs of believing on him, under the Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expreſſions of Eating his Fleſh and Drinking his Blood, they both <hi>doubted and dishelieved,</hi> and thus expreſſed their doubts and unbelief. <hi>John</hi> 6.42. <hi>How is it that he ſaith, I came down from Heaven?</hi> And V. 52. <hi>How can this man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> And V. 60. <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> Likewiſe thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>That Chriſt Crucified was unto the one ſort of them, a ſtumbling block, and unto the other fooliſhneſs;</hi> could doubt and ſay, this believing in a Crucified Chriſt is hard, and in effect they did ſay it, and ſo they doubted, if that be to doubt; for they ſaid it was an unreaſonable fooliſh thing to believe to be ſaved by a crucified Man; and that was in effect to ſay, that it was hard to believe in Chriſt. For it is certainly hard for a reaſonable man to believe, that which in his heart he judges to be unreaſonable and fooliſh. But now did this beſpeak thoſe unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> to be <hi>deeply humbled?</hi> no ſure it was ſo far from it, that it beſpoke the quite contrary, it beſpoke them <hi>deeply hardned</hi> in unbelief, and highly lifted up in pride and ſelf conceit.</p>
            <p>Our Author has another Argument to prove it to be a good doubt, becauſe (ſays he) <hi>Any body may ſee his own impotency to obey the Law of God fully, but few find the difficulty of believing.</hi> Well, be it ſo, that few find the difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and that few doubt whether it be difficult or not; doth that prove that this particular unbeliever <hi>doubts,</hi> becauſe he finds believing to be ſo difficult, that he is paſt all doubt of its being difficult, and thereupon poſitively affirms that it is difficult and hard to believe? He muſt have loſt his reaſon that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately think, that a Man who is fully convinced of the difficulty of believing, and thereupon affirms that it is hard to believe, hath a <hi>good doubt</hi> whether it be difficult or not; becauſe the generality of other Men ſeldom think of believing, or endeavour to believe, and ſo find not the difficulty of it.</p>
            <p>But (2.) ſuppoſe this particular Unbeliever do not find it ſo difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as to be paſt all doubt that it is difficult; only his mind is brought to an <hi>(aequilibrium) even ballance,</hi> and hangs in ſuſpence between theſe two, whether it be difficult, or whether it be eaſſe to believe: This ſuppoſition being true, will prove indeed that the man hath a doubt in his mind concerning the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of believing, but it doth not at all prove that it is a good doubt: The Truth is, ſuch a doubt is evil and cannot be good; for the man ought to be fully perſwaded in his mind, that to believe in Chriſt crucified with a ſaving Faith, it is really difficult and hard, yea impoſſible to Unregenerate Nature and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of God; but that to Regenerate Nature it is eaſie through the affiſtance of Gods ſpecial Grace. And ſo here can be no room at all for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers good doubt.</p>
            <p>Next our Author falls upon the reſolving of the Unbelievers pretended good doubt. And in order thereunto, he asks him, <q>What it is which he finds doth make believing difficult to him?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Our Author asks the Unbeliever <q>Whether he finds it difficult to believe, becauſe he is unwilling to be juſtified and ſaved? And this (ſaith he) the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer will deny:</q> And he may well deny it, and further tell our Author, Sir, You are very impertinent to ask me ſuch a Queſtion, for you knew well enough without asking, that that could not be the reaſon wherefore I think it difficult to believe; for no man in his right wits, was ever unwilling to be juſtified and ſaved, that is unwilling to be happy; for it is naturally neceſſary unto all men to deſire happinneſs, and therefore if the Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you talk of, be neceſſary to make me happy, and if my happineſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93177:95"/>partly conſiſt therein, you know, I cannot be unwilling to be juſtified and ſaved, becauſe I cannot be unwilling to be happy.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He asks the Unbeliever, <q>Whether he finds it difficult to believe, becauſe he is unwilling to be ſo ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, to the praiſe of Gods Grace in him, and to the avoiding of all boaſting in himſelf? And he ſaith, The Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will ſurely deny this alſo.</q> To which the Unbeliever may be ſuppoſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Sir, I thank you for your good opinion of me, by this I perceive you take me to be deeply humbled indeed, but how you ſhould come to be ſure of that, I cannot underſtand; for I am not ſure my ſelf that I am ſo deeply humbled. It is true, I confeſs and I am ſure of it, that I am willing to be ſaved, that is, to be happy: But I am not yet ſure that I am willing to be ſo ſaved in that way of deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I find by your Letter that thoſe whom you confeſs to be already true Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, find it diffioult to be throughly willing to be ſo ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, as to give all the glory of their Salvation to Gods Grace, and to take nothing of it to themſelves; how then is it poſſible for you to be ſure that I who am an Unbeliever will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I find a great unwillingneſs in my nature to be ſaved in ſuch a way of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial and deep humiliation, and that that very unwillingneſs makes it very difficult for me to believe in a Crucified Chriſt: you cannot be ſure but I may be ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer as will not deny what I really find to be the natural frame and temper of my heart: And you who are a Believer and a Miniſter ſhould not teach me to deny it againſt my natural Conſcience, nor blame me for confeſſing it: And when you have heard my ingenuous confeſſion, if you think my heart is in a very ill frame, and that I am a very wretched creature, you ſhould give me what help you can towards the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my nature changed, and my heart deeply humbled; but you think I am deeply humbled already becauſe I ſaid, this believing is hard, whereas for any thing you know to the contrary, the true reaſon of my ſo ſaying, might be becauſe I am not yet deeply humbled. Yet however it be, I thank you for your good opinion of me?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He asks the Unbeliever, <q>Whether he finds it difficult to believe, becauſe he diſtruſts the Truth of the Goſpel Record;</q> and then adds, that he dare not own this.</p>
            <p>To which again the Unbeliever may reaſonably enough Anſwer, Sir, What mean you by this, do you mean that I dare not own it becauſe of you, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of mine own <hi>natural Conſcience?</hi> If you mean that I dare not own it becauſe of you, then it ſeems you threaten me, that if I confeſs my ſelf to you, and tell you what diſtruſt I find in my own heart, you will perſecute me, or do me ſome miſchief: This better becomes a Miniſter of the Inquiſition, than a Miniſter of the Reformed Church. Or if you mean that I dare not own it, becauſe of my <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience,</hi> as if it were againſt my natural Conſcience to diſtruſt the Truth of the Goſpel record; how do you know that? You are indeed a man of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough; but you may be miſtaken for all that; And I tell you that in this you are miſtaken, for it is an ordinary thing with us Unbelievers to diſtruſt the Truth of the Goſpel Record, and I find that ſame diſtruſt often within my ſelf. I cannot conceal it from God who made and Governs the World, and knows all things in the World, as natural Religion teacheth us, and many of us believe this, though we do not believe your Supernatural poſitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and ſince I cannot conceal it from God, why ſhould I be afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it to Man, eſpecially to the Miniſters of Supernatural Poſitive Religion, a part of whoſe Office it is, to maintain the Credibility and Truth of the Gofpel Record againſt Unbelievers, and to do what they can by good and ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the Credibility and Truth of the Goſpel, and thereby to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and Convert Unbelievers to the Faith of it, and to Faith in Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ording to it. Sir, If you believe that Record your ſelf, and can give a reaſon of the Faith and Hope that is in you, as ye are bound to do; you ſhould not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Unbelievers from confeſſing the true Grounds of their not believing in Chriſt; but ſhould rather deſire and intreat them to tell you their grounds ingenuouſly what ever they be, that when you know them, you may anſwer them, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93177:95"/>ſhew there is no ſolidity in them; by this means you may be inſtrumental to bring Men off from their unbelief; and then by laying before them the ſolid Grounds and Reaſons you have for the Credibility and Truth of the Goſpel-Record, you may through the Bleſſing of God Convince and Convert ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers as I am, to the Faith of the Goſpel, and to Faith in Chriſt according to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) He asks the Unbeliever whether he finds it difficult to believe, <q>Becauſe he doubts of Chriſts ability, or <hi>goodwill</hi> to ſave? And then he ſaith, that this is to contradict the Teſtimony of God in the Goſpel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Unbeliever may readily reply, Sir, What do you mean by Chriſts Ability or Goodwill to ſave? Whether do you mean it of his Ability or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to ſave <hi>others, to wit,</hi> all the Elect in general, or of his ability or good-will to ſave <hi>me in particular?</hi> If you mean it of his Ability or Good-will toſave <hi>others, to wit,</hi> all the Elect in General, then I tell you that ſo far as I do <hi>Hiſtorically</hi> and <hi>Dogmatically believe the Scripture</hi> to be the Word of God, I do not at all doubt of Chriſts ability and good-will to ſave all the <hi>Elect in General,</hi> for I find that God hath clearly teſtified ſo much in the Goſpel, and I firmly believe his teſtimony, and do not in the leaſt contradict it.</p>
            <p>But if you mean it of his ability or willingneſs to ſave <hi>me in particular,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to name the Chapter and Verſe in the Goſpel, where God hath teſtified, that Chriſt is willing to ſave <hi>me in particular,</hi> ſo that I <hi>cannot doubt of his willingneſs to ſave me without contradicting that Teſtimony.</hi> You cannot poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſay that I am one of the Elect whom Chriſt is certainly willing to ſave; becauſe I am yet an Unbeliever, and ſo long as I am an Unbeliever, neither you nor I can poſſibly know without an immediate Revelation whether I be one of the Elect or not. I may be, or I may not be one of them: But neither you nor I can ſay determinately that I am certainly the one of them, and not the other. If you ſhall ſay, (and you have nothing elſe to ſay) <q>That whether I be one of the Elect or not, I muſt believe without doubting that Chriſt is able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave me, otherwiſe I contradict the Teſtimony of God in the Goſpel: Then indeed you will ſay ſomething to the purpoſe.</q> But We have not yet done, for I muſt now ask you, whether you would have me <hi>believe without doubting that whether I be Elect or Non-Elect,</hi> Chriſt is willing to ſave me <hi>abſolutely</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally.</hi> And if (1.) Chriſt be willing to ſave me an Unbeliever abſolutely, and that whether I be Elect or not, then it will follow by neceſſary conſequence that one Unbeliever ſhall be infallibly ſaved, even tho he be a Reprobate; and if one why not another, and another? yea, why not all? <hi>cum fit eadem ratio unius &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Since there is the ſame reaſon for one and all.</hi> The conſequence of this from Chriſts being willing to ſave me an Unbeliever abſolutely, and that whether I be Elect or not, is clear and unavoidable; for Chriſt never fails to do that which he is willing <hi>abſolutely</hi> to do, if he be able to do it; but he is certainly as able as he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Therefore if Chriſt be both able and willing abſolutely to ſave me an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer whether I be Elect or not, then I an unbeliever whether Elect or not, ſhall be infallibly ſaved. This would be good news and rare Goſpel to Unbelievers and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, if there were any Teſtimony of God for it in the Old or New Teſtament. But an Unbeliever may <hi>doubt</hi> of Chriſts willingneſs to ſave in this abſolute ſenſe, without fear of <hi>contradicting the Teſtimony of God in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If to avoid this abſurdity, you ſay that whatever I be, Elect or not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Chriſt is willing to ſave me an Unbeliever, <hi>conditionally, If I ſincerely believe and Repent;</hi> now I Underſtand you very well, and have nothing to ſay but that you are come <hi>off from your principle,</hi> and fall in with thoſe you call the <hi>New Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> and preached to me the <hi>new Divinity,</hi> that there is a <hi>Conditional Goſpel Covenant,</hi> according to the tenour whereof, Chriſt is willing to ſave any unbeliever, whatever he be, on condition that he ſincerely and effectually believe. If to break through this net in which your are caught, you ſhall ſay, that if I be <hi>not one of the Elect,</hi> Chriſt is no wiſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93177:96"/>to ſave me, <hi>either abſolutely, or conditionally?</hi> I reply, why did you then, ſpeaking to me in particular, ſay, That for me <hi>to doubt of Chriſts good-will to ſave, is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Teſtimony of God in the Goſpel?</hi> The Queſtion was not, whether or no Chriſt be willing to ſave ſome <hi>other men;</hi> but whether he be willing to ſave <hi>ME</hi> or not? And whereas you made a ſhew as if you would reſolve my doubt by determining that queſtion in the affirmative, that Chriſt is willing to ſave <hi>me,</hi> and that <hi>I muſt not doubt</hi> of his willingneſs to ſave <hi>me,</hi> or if I do, then I <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Gods Word:</hi> Now to keep up your ſeparation from thoſe you call the <hi>New Divines,</hi> you would bring your ſelf off by telling me, that you do not know whether Chriſt be <hi>any wiſe willing abſolutely or conditionally</hi> to ſave <hi>me.</hi> Is not this an excellent way to reſolve my doubt which you put into my head, whether Chriſt be willing to ſave me, to tell me that truly you do not know whether he be any wiſe willing to ſave me or not, but if I doubt of his willingneſs to ſave <hi>ſome other</hi> men, I contradict the Word of God? Thus you reſolve my doubt (Whether Chriſt be any wiſe willing to ſave me or not?) by confirming it. I ſay, <hi>I doubt</hi> of Chriſts willingneſs to ſave me an Unbeliever; and you ſay, <hi>you doubt</hi> of it too, for you do not know whether he be willing or not; and becauſe the thing is thus doubtful both to me and you, therefore I muſt no more doubt of it. This is the beſt way that you have to reſolve this doubt of mine, which your ſelf have raiſed, unleſs you <hi>go over</hi> to <hi>your Brethren,</hi> and ſay, that Chriſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly willing to ſave me, (whatever I be) <hi>upon condition</hi> that I ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent. And yet you ſhall not eſcape into their Camp without one thruſt more at you, I mean without objecting one difficulty more which lyes in my way to believing. This laſt Objection I have <hi>learned of your ſelf</hi> likewiſe, and therefore I expect a clear anſwer from you, for it's to be hoped that you are a wiſer man than to raiſe a Spirit which you cannot lay again. Thus then I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as you have taught me:</p>
            <p>Unbeliever. <hi>I cannot believe on Jeſus Christ, becauſe of the difficulty of the acting this Faith, for a Divine Power is needful to draw it forth, which I find not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Let.</hi> pag. 17.</note> This is a very powerful argument to prove the difficulty of believing, for if it be <hi>impoſſible</hi> for me to believe, then it is <hi>difficult, with a witneſs</hi> for me to believe: But it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for me to believe without a <hi>Divine Power, that being needful to draw forth the Act of believing,</hi> and I do not find that divine Power in or with me: Therefore it is <hi>difficult</hi> for me to believe. This is the argument which you have taught me, and it has the appearance of a demonſtration; at leaſt it proves invincibly that I had <hi>reaſon</hi> to ſay before, without any doubt, <hi>That this believing is hard;</hi> though by your Logick which draws <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> darkneſs out of light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ye inferred that I was <hi>a good doubter,</hi> becauſe I did <hi>not doubt</hi> at all, but was <hi>ſure</hi> that it was <hi>hard</hi> for me <hi>to believe:</hi> and ſince ye <hi>your ſelf</hi> have furniſhed me with ſo ſtrong an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to Evince the Truth of what I ſaid, that it is hard for me to believe; I do expect from you a clear, ſolid, ſatisfactory anſwer; otherwiſe I ſhall be tempted to ſuſpect you to be your ſelf a ſecret unbeliever, and that your deſign in ſuggeſting ſuch Arguments to Unbelievers, and not giving a ſolid Anſwer to them, is to confirm ſuch as I am, in unbelief and (as it may happen) to increaſe the number of unbelievers: Or if I ſhould be miſtaken in ſuſpecting that you your ſelf had ſuch a <hi>formal</hi> deſign, yet I no wiſe doubt but am ſure that the thing hath a <hi>natural tendency</hi> to confirm and harden ſinners in their unbelief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miniſters Anſwer.</hi> I deſire you Unbeliever, not to ſuſpect me as if I were ſecretly one of your Fraternity, nor yet to be afraid of any miſchief that may enſue upon my method for Converting Unbelievers, which I have publiſhed for the Inſtruction of the younger Miniſters. To cure you of your ſuſpicion of me, and to prevent any hurt to your ſelf or others; I have given an Anſwer to your Argument which you had from me, and thus it is word for word. [<hi>Believing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93177:96"/>in Jeſus Christ is no work, but a reſting on Jeſus Chriſt: And this pretence</hi> (of its being difficult) <hi>is as unreaſonable, as that if a Man wearyed with a Journey, and who is not able to go one step further, ſhould argue,</hi> I am ſo tyred that I am not able to lye down; <hi>when indeed he can neither ſtand nor go.</hi> This is my anſwer, Unbeliever, and what do you think of it? Is it not a clear ſolid ſatisfactory anſwer? Do not you ſee the light breaking forth from all the parts of it? Do not you alſo ſee the darkneſs of your Objection flying away before the light of it, as the ſmall duſt and dry leaves fly before the wind.</p>

               <hi>Unbelievers Reply.</hi> Sir, I will tell you by and by what I <hi>ſee:</hi> But Firſt, I muſt tell you what I think, and to be plain with you, I <hi>think</hi> this your laſt anſwer is much like all the reſt that went before, there is hardly a good one amongſt them; and the difference is, that this is the <hi>worst</hi> in the whole pack. And to make this good, I offer theſe things following to the conſideration of all men of common ſenſe and reaſon, as well as of Chriſtian Believers.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Objection ſaith, That Faith is a <hi>difficult</hi> Act, and proves it to be difficult, becauſe, <hi>impoſſible, without a Divine Power,</hi> which the Unbeliever ſinds not. To which you anſwer, That Believing is <hi>no work, but a reſting,</hi> and ſo by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Terms and putting <hi>Work</hi> for <hi>Act,</hi> you think to impoſe upon ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſuch like Perſons, and to make them think that you have ſaid much, when you have ſaid nothing or worſe than nothing: And that you have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Objection, when you have rather confirmed it: The Objection ſays and proves that <hi>Faith is a difficult Act,</hi> becauſe, <hi>impoſſible without a Divine Power:</hi> This you do not deny, but only deny that it is a <hi>work,</hi> and ſo that it is a <hi>difficult work.</hi> If then there be an <hi>Act</hi> that is <hi>no Work,</hi> (as you ſeem to intimate) tho Faith ſhould not be a difficult <hi>work,</hi> yet it may be a difficult <hi>Act,</hi> ſo difficult that a man cannot believe aright without <hi>Divine Aſſiſtance,</hi> and this was all the Objection was deſigned to prove, for it makes no mention of the word <hi>(work),</hi> it neither affirms nor denies <hi>Faith</hi> to be a <hi>work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) I demand why you change the Terms and deny <hi>Faith to be a work,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Objection did not affirm it to be a <hi>work,</hi> but to be an <hi>act,</hi> and a <hi>difficult act;</hi> becauſe impoſſible to Humane Nature without the Powerful Aſſiſtance of God? I cannot eaſily imagine what reaſon you had to deny <hi>Faith to be a work,</hi> inſtead of denying it to be an <hi>act,</hi> and a <hi>difficult act;</hi> if you intended to anſwer the Objection which only affirms <hi>Faith to be a difficult act.</hi> But whatever reaſon might move you to deny Faith to be a <hi>work,</hi> which I do not well underſtand; yet this I know, that your denying Faith to be a <hi>work,</hi> falls out very unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for you, and turns to your own ſhame;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Let.</hi> pag. 11.</note> for you your ſelf had ſaid before, and proved from Scripture, <hi>to wit,</hi> from <hi>John</hi> 6.28, 29. That <hi>Faith is a work,</hi> yea that it is the <hi>work of God,</hi> the <hi>great work</hi> of God, <hi>the</hi> great work <hi>which we do,</hi> and <hi>which we cannot</hi> do too <hi>ſoon.</hi> Theſe are your own words: And yet within the compaſs of ſix Pages after, you abſolutely deny that <hi>Faith is any work at all.</hi> This brings to my mind the old ſaying, <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem, A lyar had need to have a good memory.</hi> And by this ſign and token I know that you are a weak deceived man your ſelf, or that you are a deceiver of others. It will no wiſe relieve you to ſay, that though <hi>Faith be a Work,</hi> yet it doth not <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as a work,</hi> but as an <hi>Inſirument.</hi> For (1.) here you abſolutely deny <hi>it to be a work,</hi> and that in anſwer to an Objection which did <hi>not relate to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Therefore (2.) I ſay that here was no occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Juſtification</hi> at all, and conſequently no occaſion to affirm that Faith juſtifies as an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and to deny that it juſtifies as a <hi>work;</hi> for the Queſtion here is not at all, how we are juſtified by Faith, whether by Faith as a <hi>work,</hi> or by Faith as an <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but all the Queſtion is, <hi>whether Faith be difficult to an Unbeliever or not.</hi> The Objection affirms it to be difficult, becauſe it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to Humane Nature <hi>without the Grace of God;</hi> you in anſwer to the Objection, <hi>deny it to be difficult,</hi> becauſe it is no <hi>work.</hi> So that it is evident this your denying Faith to be a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93177:97"/>work, relates not to the <hi>manner of Faiths justifying a Man;</hi> but to the <hi>difficulty of a Mans getting and uſing of Faith.</hi> (3.) It is altogether impertinent here to deny Faith to be <hi>a work,</hi> in the Office or Act of Juſtification; for though it were granted, that Faith is not conſidered as a <hi>work</hi> in the Act of juſtifying, yet if it be a work in its <hi>own Act of Existence,</hi> the Objection remains in its full Strength and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; for ſtill it is true which the Objection aſſerts, that its <hi>very difficult for an Unbeliever to produce the Act, or do the Work of Faith.</hi> This you ſaw, and therefore to cut the Sinews, and to take away the main force of the Argument, you abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny Faith to be a <hi>Work.</hi> This was your Intention in ſaying that Faith is <hi>no work,</hi> otherwiſe your Anſwer was wholly impertinent to the Objection. And indeed it muſt be confeſſed, that if your Anſwer were true, if it were true that Faith is <hi>no Work at all in any ſence;</hi> the Objection hath loſt all its Strength, and falls dead to the ground. But that your Anſwer is not true, I have had it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from your ſelf under your own hand, affirming and proving that <hi>Faith is a great Work, which we cannot do too ſoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leaſt you ſhould endeavour to bring your ſelf off, by ſaying that Faith is no <hi>outward bodily Work,</hi> and that, that was your meaning in ſaying that Faith is no Work, I give you a third Anſwer, and therein,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I demand, what you mean by the Word <hi>(Work)</hi> when you ſay that Faith is <hi>no Work?</hi> Whether you do mean an <hi>outward bodily</hi> Work, or an <hi>inward Heart-work?</hi> And (1.) I appeal to your own Conſcience, that you did not mean an <hi>outward Bodily Work;</hi> for no Body ever ſaid or thought, that Faith is an outward Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Work. And why ſhould you in Anſwer to an Argument deny, that which no Body ever affirmed; yea and lay the main ſtreſs too of your Anſwer upon that denial?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) You could not give that Anſwer to ſuch an Objection, unleſs you was in a Dream, or out of your right Mind; for to Anſwer ſo as to ſay, that Faith is not an <hi>outward Bodily work,</hi> but an <hi>inward Heart-work,</hi> doth not in the leaſt touch the Objection; though that be moſt true that Faith is no outward bodily work, yet if Faith be an inward Heart-work, the Objection ſtands in its full force and ſtrength; for <hi>inward Heart-work,</hi> is the <hi>moſt hard and difficult work,</hi> therefore if Faith be an inward Heart-work, it muſt needs be <hi>ſtill hard and difficult to believe,</hi> which is the very thing that the Objection was brought to prove; therefore if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Anſwer the Objection by denying Faith to be a Work; you muſt alſo intend to deny that it is <hi>an inward Heart-work,</hi> and ſo that it is any work at all either inward or outward; and if that were true, you had indeed effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Objection: But that is not true, for</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is notoriouſly falſe, that Faith is <hi>no inward Heart-work,</hi> for to be an inward Work of the Heart is nothing, but to be an inward Act of the Heart, and it is moſt certain and evident that Faith is an inward Act of the Heart; for <hi>Believers</hi> (as you do confeſs) <hi>find by Spiritual Senſe and feeling that Faith is an inward Act of the Heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Let.</hi> p. 7.</note> and the Scripture ſaith expreſly that <hi>with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And therefore Faith is an inward Work of the Heart, conſequently it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe which you ſay, that <hi>Faith is no Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Whereas you ſay, that <hi>Faith is no Work, but a reſting on Jeſus Christ:</hi> I reply, (1.) That if Faith be no Work either outward, or inward, <hi>becauſe it is a resting;</hi> then Faith is no <hi>inward Act,</hi> for an inward Act is an inward Work, and if Faith be an inward Act, it is alſo an inward Work; but you your ſelf, <hi>Page</hi> 7th. of your Letter expreſly ſay, that <hi>Faith is an inward Act,</hi> and I have proved it by Scripture to be an inward Act, therefore it is utterly falſe which you ſay, that Faith is <hi>no Work at all,</hi> no not an inward Work, <hi>becauſe it is a resting on Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Faith is <hi>both</hi> an inward Work, and a reſting on Chriſt. <hi>Resting on Christ</hi> is a Figurative Expreſſion, and Faith is called by that Name, it is ſaid to be a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt, becauſe the effect or conſequent of the Act of Faith in Chriſt, is the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93177:97"/>
               <hi>rest of the Soul,</hi> the ſatisfaction and quiet of the Mind, the eaſe of the Heart, and the Peace of the Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If this ſenſe of the form of Speech, <hi>(Resting on Christ),</hi> by which the Act of Faith is expreſſed, as it is a means of cauſing, and as it connotes the foreſaid ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; if (I ſay) this do not pleaſe you, but you will have <hi>resting on Christ,</hi> to ſignifie a total Ceſſation from any inward Act: Then I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That you ſeem to be ſhifting about from one Sect to another, and for a time to have taken up your <hi>rest</hi> among the <hi>Quietists,</hi> the Diſciples of <hi>Molino's</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Madamoiſelle de Bourignon</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> For it is ſaid to be their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that a man ſhould <hi>ceaſe from all Action, outward and inward; and when the Soul is in a State of Non-Action, and perfect rest from all Labour whatſoever,</hi> then a Man is moſt Religious, and beſt diſpoſed for converſe with and enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If Faith be no inward Act, but a reſting on Chriſt in ſuch a ſenſe, as that it is a Ceſſation from, and a Negation of all Act and Action; then you need no more to endeavour the Converſion of me, or of any other Unbeliever; for if that be true Faith, <hi>then a meer nothing is true Faith;</hi> and I will aſſure you, I have that nothing, as much as ever I can have it: You your ſelf in your Letter call me an <hi>Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and that ſignifies one that <hi>wants Faith;</hi> now if I want <hi>the Act of Faith,</hi> I muſt needs have <hi>the Negation of the Act of Faith,</hi> (in ſuch a way as a Negation can be had), and this Negation is <hi>a perfect Ceſſation</hi> and reſting from any Act of Faith, and further, <hi>this Negation, Ceſſation and Reſting</hi> is <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, <hi>(according to you).</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows by clear and neceſſary Conſequence that <hi>by wanting the Act of Faith, I have Faith,</hi> and <hi>by being an Unbeliever, I am as good a Believer as your ſelf.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need no more labour to convert me, than I need to convert you, but let us both reſt together among the <hi>new Quietiſts,</hi> if you pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) And now, Sir, I would be content to <hi>reſt,</hi> if you would let me alone; but are not you like to diſturb my <hi>reſt,</hi> by clamouring againſt me, that <hi>I</hi> am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in pretending that it is <hi>hard and difficult for</hi> an Unbeliever to believe in Chriſt without the powerful Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace? And to prove that I am unreaſonable in this, you boldly affirm it upon your Word (as your manner is), and with appearance of much Gravity, you illuſtrate it by a ſimilitude taken from a <hi>weary Traveller, who is ſo tired with his journey that he can neither ſtand ſtill, nor yet go one ſtep further, but muſt of neceſſity lye down and reſt. Now</hi> (ſay you) <hi>if this Man in theſe circumſtances ſhould ſay, Oh I find it difficult to lye down, for I am ſo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I am not able to lie down, though indeed I can neither ſtand nor go; would it not be accounted very unreaſonable?</hi> And juſt ſo, it is unreaſonable for you an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer to pretend, That it is ſo difficult for you to believe, that you cannot do it without the powerful Grace of God; for believing is <hi>reſting,</hi> it is ceaſing from all Action, and conſequently it is ſo far from being difficult, that it is <hi>one of the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things in the World; it is of that Nature, that you cannot avoid the doing of it, no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re than a weary Traveller can avoid lying down, when he is ſo tired, that indeed he can neither ſtand nor go.</hi> This is the force of your Reaſoning in the 17th. <hi>Page</hi> of your Letter, line 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. whereby you would prove me to be unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in ſaying that it is difficult for an Unbeliever to believe on Chriſt without the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>I have conſidered this your profound Reaſoning, for the Eaſineſs of Believing on Chriſt without the Grace of God, and now that I underſtand it, my fear of being diſturbed by it, is over and gone; yea I am beholding to you for it, and I thank you Sir: For this which I was afraid would have been a diſturbance to me, is like to be a means of bringing us both to <hi>reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have told you before, what I <hi>thought;</hi> now (according to my Promiſe) I will tell you what I <hi>ſee.</hi> Why, in ſhort, by <hi>the Light</hi> of this your <hi>Illuſtration,</hi> I ſee that I (an Unbeliever) am as good a Believer as you are, and that it muſt be ſo and cannot be otherwiſe; for as the weary Traveller that cannot poſſibly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93177:98"/>ſtand or go, <hi>muſt lie down, and cannot but lie down,</hi> unleſs he be hindred by <hi>force or Miracle:</hi> So you and I <hi>cannot but believe, unleſs we be hindered by Miracle.</hi> But there is no fear of that, God hath wrought many Miracles heretofore to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> men to believe, but he never did nor will work <hi>a Miracle to hinder us from believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will never more Object <hi>the difficulty of Believing,</hi> for want of the powerful Grace of God to enable me thereunto, for if this Doctrine be true, there needs <hi>no Grace to enable us to believe, for believing is reſting and doing nothing, and that we can do as well without, as with the help of Grace; nay we cannot but do it, unleſs we be hindred from reſting and doing nothing, and be irreſiſtibly ſtirred up to Work and Act by Miracle.</hi> But, as I ſaid, there is <hi>no fear</hi> of that, ſince <hi>Working</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> would <hi>hinder us from Believing:</hi> And to <hi>hinder us from Believing,</hi> is contrary to the true uſe and end of Miracles.</p>
            <p>And Sir, as I will never complain more of the difficulty of believing, ſo in the Name of the whole Fraternity of Unbelievers, I thank you for your great kindneſs to them, and for this ſweet and comfortable Doctrine <hi>(if it be true)</hi> which you have taught us all in your Letter, which I hear is much cryed up by ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>London,</hi> who love reſt and eaſe.</p>
            <p>Now we might have all reſted quietly together, were it not for thoſe you call the <hi>New and Young Divines,</hi> whom you have charged with <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi> This was not wiſely done of you, for you have thereby awakened them from their <hi>reſt,</hi> and it is to be feared, that by loud Recriminations, they will diſturb you and us both, and proclaim the ſecret to the World, that <hi>you your ſelf</hi> are Confederate with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, Semipelagians and Unbelievers.</hi> For it is undeniable matter of Fact, that it is a branch of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and the very <hi>Root</hi> and Heart of <hi>Semipelagianiſm,</hi> That <hi>Men can believe in Chriſt with a juſtifying Faith, by the Power of Nature, without the Supernatural Grace of God.</hi> And if your ſimilitude hold good, men not only <hi>can believe,</hi> but which is more, they <hi>cannot poſſibly chooſe, but they must of Neceſſity believe</hi> without the help of Grace, unleſs they be hindered by a Miracle exciting them to Act and Work, and to ceaſe from reſt. Sir, how you can come to <hi>Reſt</hi> and Peace with thoſe brisk <hi>Young Divines,</hi> whoſe Age inclines them to <hi>Action,</hi> more than to <hi>Reſt,</hi> I do not pretend to know; but this I know, that upon your foreſaid Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Unbeliever and you are agreed; and if you will be ſtedfaſt and ſtand to your Principle, we ſhall live together in perfect <hi>quietneſs,</hi> and never more differ about Believing.</p>
            <p>Thus we have given an account of <hi>our Authors</hi> Way and Method of Converting an Unbeliever to Faith in Chriſt; <q>(which is more than a reſting on Chriſt, for it is a Grace whereby we aſſent to Jeſus his being the Chriſt, the Son of God and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour of Men; and Conſent to take him for our Prince and Saviour, and as ſuch receive him on his own Terms, and then reſt, relie, and truſt on him for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</q> We have ſhewed alſo, what a weak and ridiculous way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod it is, and how eaſily an Unbeliever may Anſwer all that he hath ſaid in the 16. and 17. Pages of his Letter mentioned before; except a few at his firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, he hath hardly made one right ſtep in the whole courſe of that Advice, which he takes upon him to give unto <hi>Miniſters,</hi> how they ought to deal with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers in labouring to Convert them unto Faith in Chriſt. He hath plainly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd our Cauſe</hi> to the <hi>Unbeliever,</hi> who hath brought him by his laſt Objection, to take up with a Piece of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and with <hi>the groſſeſt Semipelagianiſm</hi> that hath been heard of in the Chriſtian Church; ſo weak is he (not <hi>wicked</hi> we hope) that he could think of no other way to Anſwer that Objection, but by denying that Faith is <hi>any Work at all</hi> (though therein he ſhamefully contradicts himſelf, and the expreſs Word of God) and by affirming that it is a <hi>reſting,</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe, as imports that it is <hi>neither Work nor Act,</hi> but a meer Ceſſation from Working and Acting, <hi>a doing nothing at all;</hi> and from thence he labours to ſhew the Unbeliever
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93177:98"/>that it is <hi>not difficult</hi> to believe, and illuſtrates it by ſuch a ſimilitude as will make any conſidering man who reads it and underſtands the uſe he makes of it, to think that he muſt be a <hi>Semipelagian,</hi> who holds that a man can believe unto Juſtification without any Subjective Supernatural Grace of God at all.</p>
            <p>Whereas he ought to have acknowledged the Truth of the Objection, that it is indeed <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>impoſſible</hi> too, for a natural man by the power of nature ever to believe, but that it is poſſible and eaſy too by the Grace of God. And then he ſhould have directed the Unbeliever unto the <hi>means</hi> whereby Grace to believe is ordinarily obtained from God through Chriſt, and ſhould have adviſed him to wait, and continue waiting on God in the uſe of his appointed means, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be much in praying, as well as he can, for Grace to help in time of need, and deſiring the prayers of Chriſts Miniſters and People. But not a word of this, nay, inſtead of adviſing the Unbeliever to uſe <hi>Gods means,</hi> and ſeek the Grace of Faith from God through Chriſt, he gives him to underſtand that Faith is nothing but a <hi>reſting</hi> from all work and action, and that it is no more difficult to believe, than it is for a <hi>weary Traveller to lye down and reſt, when he is ſo tyred that he can neither ſtand nor go.</hi> And after he hath told the <hi>Miniſters</hi> that they ought <hi>thus</hi> to reſolve the doubts and anſwer the arguments of Unbelievers, he hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to conclude that by ſuch reaſonings with an Unbeliever from the Goſpel, <hi>the Lord will (as he hath often done) convey Faith to him, and joy and peace by believing.</hi> This is like all the reſt, the Concluſion and the Premiſes are at irreconcileable variance with one another: The Concluſion ſaith that the Lord <hi>will convey Faith to the Unbeliever,</hi> by the reaſonings in the premiſes, and yet one of thoſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is that Faith is nothing but a <hi>reſting,</hi> and ſuch a reſting as ſignifies a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all actings; and that an Unbeliever <hi>needs no more help to believe, than a weary Travellour needs help to lye down and reſt, when he is ſo tyred that he can neither ſtand nor go.</hi> We think it is a ſort of Blaſphemy, to ſay wittingly and willingly, that ſuch reaſonings as ſome of thoſe we have noted in the 16 and 17 Pages of the Letter, are either in and from the Goſpel, or that the Lord makes uſe of ſuch <hi>ſelf contradicting, confounding fulſhood,</hi> as means of conveying Faith into the Hearts of his people. And becauſe in this part of his Letter, he ſpeaks to us that are <hi>Ministers,</hi> and either bids us tell the Unbeliever ſo and ſo; or elſe he affirms that we do tell him ſo and ſo; we muſt declare to the World that we will follow his advice no further than we find it agreeable to Scripture and Reaſon, (which ſometimes we do find, and oftentimes the contrary, as we have proved), but as for what he affirms, that Miniſters tell the Unbeliever, that <hi>Faith is not difficult,</hi> that it is no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to an Unbeliever, than lying down is to a man when he is ſo tyred and weary that he can neither ſtand nor go; we proteſt <hi>we are none of thoſe Miniſters,</hi> we never did, and through Grace, never will tell any Unbeliver ſuch an <hi>abominable falſhood.</hi> We know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters but <hi>our Author</hi> that Preaches ſuch Doctrine, and we have endeavoured to make <hi>him aſhamed of</hi> it, in hopes to bring him off from it. We truſt that after we have thus publickly declared againſt <hi>our Authors</hi> Way and Method of Converting Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to Faith in Chriſt, and plainly ſhewed the falſhood and folly of it in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, the World will not be ſo unjuſt as to reproach the <hi>Non-Conformiſt Miniſters in England</hi> with that <hi>Ridiculous way of Preaching the Goſpel</hi> to Unbelievers, which we our ſelves have Confuted and expoſed, on purpoſe to <hi>prevent the Scandal</hi> which might otherwiſe ariſe if ſuch things ſhould be ſuffered to paſs current amongſt us, without any publick diſapproving of them.</p>

               <p>HIS Firſt great Calumny which comprehends all the reſt that lye ſcattered here and there throughout his Letter, is that we are <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Chriſts pure Goſpel,</hi> and differ from him and his party, <hi>in the main points of the Goſpel which they believe, and live by the Faith of, and look to be ſaved in: And by the Preaching whereof, they have Converted Sinners unto God, and have built up Saints in Holineſs and Comfort:</hi> Yea, he carries the Accuſation ſo far as to ſay that we Preach a <hi>New Goſpel,</hi> an <hi>Arminian Goſpel, to the certain peril of their Souls that Believe it:</hi> And that <hi>our cauſe is Coincident with the cauſe both of Arminius and alſo of Pelagius.</hi> That this is aſſerted by him, and that we do not Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate him, in reporting his Calumny againſt us, is evident from the expreſs words of his Letter; For pag. 10. He ſays, <hi>We ſee the pure Goſpel of Chriſt corrupted, and an Arminian Goſpel New-Vampt, and obtruded on People, to the certain peril of the Souls of ſuch as believe it.</hi> And a little after in the ſame page, he ſays, <hi>That we are ſuch Miniſters as creep in, not only to ſpy out, but to deſtroy, not ſo much the Goſpel-Liberty, as the Goſpel-Salvation we have in Christ Jeſus, and to bring us back under the Yoke of Legal-bondage. And indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the caſe in that Epiſtle to the Galatians and ours have a great affinity.</hi> By which words he gives the World to underſtand that we are ſuch Miniſters as are like the <hi>falſe-teachers</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> who taught people that they could not be juſtified and ſaved unleſs they became <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo far as to be Circumciſed and to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore that <hi>Pauls</hi> curſe recorded, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. falls upon us, [<hi>Though we or an Angel from Heaven Preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have Preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> Again in Pag. 13. he intimates that he and his party <hi>cannot be at peace with us unleſs they be either ſilent as to the main points of the Goſpel, or elſe ſwallow down Arminian Schemes of the Goſpel, contrary to the New Teſtament, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Reformed Churches in their greateſt Purity.</hi>—And in the ſame page he ſays, <hi>That we might know that the most Learned and Godly in the Christian World, have for ſome ages maintained and defended the ſame Doctrine, which he and his party ſtand for.</hi> And he names three Authors who have done ſo, <hi>to wit, Bradwardin, Twiſs,</hi> and <hi>Ames.</hi> And then to drive the nail home, that it may ſtick to us, he ſaith, <hi>That Judicious Obſervers cannot but already perceive a Coincidency between our cauſe, and the cauſe of thoſe two Peſts of Chriſts Church,</hi> Pelagius <hi>and</hi> Arminius, <hi>and that they fear more when we ſhall either be driven out of our Lurking holes by force of Argument, or ſhall think fit to diſcover our ſecret ſentiments.</hi> And when that day comes, he threatens us that we ſhall find <hi>Enemies and Oppoſers enough both at home and abroad.</hi> This is his <hi>first great Charge</hi> which we have faithfully Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from his own expreſs words; and a dreadful charge it is, if it were <hi>true,</hi> but of the truth of it, we find no proof but <hi>his bare word;</hi> and what credit his word deſerves, we have ſeen already. Indeed what he ſaith of his <hi>Judicious Obſervers,</hi> their <hi>ſearing that our cauſe is not only Coincident with</hi> Pelagius <hi>his cauſe,</hi> but that we are further gone off from the Truth than <hi>he;</hi> we cannot tell whether it be true or falſe. It may be <hi>true,</hi> for we read in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.5. That ſome men have been <hi>in great fear, where there was no juſt cauſe of fear.</hi> And it may be <hi>falſe</hi> for ſome men can write lyes, and ſay that they and, their Confederates do fear
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93177:99"/>that which they do not fear, but only for their own ends would make ſimple People believe that they fear. So that for ought we know, it may be either true or falſe, that he and his party have ſuch fears of us. But the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knows, and we know, that they have no juſt cauſe to entertain ſuch fears and jealouſies of us; and it is a ſure ſign that they have but little if any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Love, when without cauſe, they entertain ſuch jealous fears of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they are departed or will depart from the Truth of the Goſpel, more than <hi>Pelagius.</hi> And as to what he ſays, that our Cauſe is <hi>Coincident with that of Arminius and Pelagius,</hi> we are as ſure that it is <hi>falſe,</hi> as we can be that there is any ſuch thing as truth or falſehood in the World. And <hi>our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> alſo muſt needs <hi>know it to be falſe,</hi> and muſt lye againſt his knowledge and conſcience, if he knows what the Errors of <hi>Pelagius</hi> were, and that we are (as he affirms us to be) <hi>middle-way-men,</hi> who ſteer a middle courſe between the Orthodox and the <hi>Arminians.</hi> For the great fault, that theſe <hi>middle-way-men</hi> are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with is, that they hold Univerſal Redemption in ſuch a ſenſe, as neither to agree with the Orthodox, that is, <hi>the moſt rigid Calviniſts,</hi> who (contrary to the expreſs mind of <hi>Calvin</hi>) deny that in <hi>any ſound ſenſe</hi> Chriſt can be ſaid to have Redeemed all mankind; nor yet with the <hi>Arminians</hi> who affirm that Chriſt hath Redeemed all the Reprobate World, in the ſame ſenſe that he hath Redeemed his Select People, whom he choſe in Chriſt before the foundation of the World unto ſpecial effectual Grace in this life, and unto eternal Glory hereafter in the life to come. This is to be a <hi>middle-way-man,</hi> to hold univerſal Redemption <hi>in ſuch a ſenſe</hi> as neither pleaſeth the <hi>Arminian,</hi> nor the <hi>Rigid Antiarminian.</hi> This <hi>our Author</hi> knows well enough, and if he knows as well what were the Errors of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> then he cannot chooſe but know that it is a lye to ſay that <hi>Our Cauſe is Coincident with the cauſe of Pelagius:</hi> For to be <hi>Coincident</hi> is to be the <hi>ſame.</hi> But it is not poſſible, that our cauſe ſhould be the <hi>ſame with Pelagius his cauſe,</hi> if we be <hi>middle-way-men,</hi> and hold univerſal Redemption as we are ſaid to be and to do; for <hi>Pelagius</hi> did not hold but denyed <hi>univerſal Redemption</hi> from <hi>ſin,</hi> or <hi>puniſhment of ſin;</hi> and it was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the <hi>Pelagian Errors</hi> above twelve hundred years ago, that he <hi>ſo</hi> denyed <hi>univerſal Redemption.</hi> This may be unknown to our Author, and he may be apt to think that ſure this is a Fiction of the <hi>middle-way-men;</hi> but if he be <hi>ignorant</hi> of this matter of fact, let not his <hi>ignorance</hi> make him boldly deny it, before he know what evidence there is for the Truth of it. We give him theſe two Arguments to prove the Truth of this matter of fact, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed univerſal Redemption.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is known and acknowledged by all who have any underſtanding of theſe matters, and <hi>our Author</hi> himſelf knows it, That <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed <hi>Original ſin;</hi> from whence it follows by neceſſary Conſequence that he muſt needs alſo deny <hi>Univerſal Redemption</hi> of all Mankind. For Infants that dye in their Infancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they commit any actual ſin, are a conſiderable part of Mankind: the Infants who from the beginning of the World have dyed, and who daily do dy, and hereafter will be dying to the Worlds end, and that both within and without the Church, before they commit any actual ſin, will make up a vaſt number; even many Millions of the race of Mankind. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed that theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> who ſo dye in their Infancy, have any ſin either Original or Actual to be redeemed from, and therefore he muſt needs deny alſo that they were Redeemed, and conſequently he muſt needs deny univerſal Redemption of all Mankind. Where there is no manner of ſin, there is no manner of puniſhment due for ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no room for Redemption by the Blood and Death of Chriſt either from ſin or puniſhment. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> denied that Infants who dy in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy have any manner of ſin, or that any manner of puniſhment is due to them for their ſin. Therefore <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed that ſuch Infants are Redeemed by the Blood and Death of Chriſt either from ſin or puniſhment, and conſequently he denied univerſal Redemption.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93177:100"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) Our Second Argument to prove the truth of this matter of Fact, is from the teſtimony of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who is a very competent witneſs, becauſe he lived at the ſame time with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and wrote againſt him, and confuted his Errors and Hereſies. Now <hi>Augustin</hi> in his writings againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Diſciples, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies plainly that <hi>they denyed univerſal Redemption</hi> on the account aforeſaid. For thus he writes: <hi>Contra duas Epiſtolas Pelagianorum,</hi> lib. 2. ad <hi>Bonifacium,</hi> cap. 2. <hi>Manichaei di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt Deum bonum non omnium naturarum eſſe creatorem:</hi> Pelagiani <hi>dicunt, Deum non eſſe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium aetatum in hominibus mundatorem, ſalvatorem, liberatorem. Catholica utroſque redarguit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The</hi> Manicheans <hi>ſay, That the good God is not the Creator of all natures. The</hi> Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>ſay, That God is not the Purifier, the Saviour, the Deliverer</hi> or Redeemer of all Ages <hi>among men: But the Catholick Church refutes them both; defending both againſt the</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeans <hi>the Creature of God, leaſt any nature ſhould be denyed to be made by him; and alſo againſt the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>that the human nature which is loſt in all Ages, might be ſought out and ſaved.</hi> Again the ſame <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in ſeveral other of his Books proves againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. both that <hi>all mankind,</hi> even Infants who dy in their Infancy,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de Civit. dei.</hi> cap. 6. <hi>&amp; contra Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> are guilty of Original ſin, and alſo that in ſome ſenſe, <hi>all are Redeemed</hi> by the death of Chriſt. In the Second Book of his imperfect Work againſt <hi>Julian</hi> a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Biſhop. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. having alledged 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all,</hi> &amp;c. He adds, <hi>Unde colligitur quod dicit Apoſtolus, ergo omnes mortui ſunt, &amp; pro omnibus mortuus est: Dic apertè, mortui parvuli non ſunt, qui peccatum nullum habem; morte pro ſe Chriſti, in quâ baptizentur, non opus habent. Jam dic evidenter, quod latenter ſentis, quoniam ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is prodis tuâ diſputatione quod ſentis. From which words we gather,</hi> or inferr <hi>for what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, Therefore all are dead, and he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>died for them all:</hi> ſay <hi>plainly, Infan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s are not dead, who have no ſin. They have no need of the death of Christ for them, into which they ſhould be baptized. Now ſpeak out evidently, that which thou thinkeſt ſecretly, for thou do'ſt ſufficiently diſcover by thy Diſputation, what it is that thou thinkeſt.</hi> By this and the forgoing paſſage of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> it is very evident that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> firſt denied that Infants had any Original ſin. Secondly, That Chriſt died for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to Redeem them either from ſin, or puniſhment of ſin. For though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>ſpeak out,</hi> and ſay plainly that Chriſt died not for Infants, yet they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, and held it for a truth, that he did not dy for Infants to Redeem them, becauſe they were not guilty of any evil either of ſin or puniſhment, from which they could be Redeemed. By theſe two Arguments our Author and others may plainly ſee that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denied univerſal Redemption by the blood-ſhedding and death of Chriſt. And this being ſo, how is it poſſible that we ſhould be <hi>middle-way-men,</hi> who hold univerſal Redemption, and yet that <hi>our cauſe ſhould be Coincident with that of Pelagius</hi> who <hi>denied univerſal Redemption?</hi> Surely our Author cannot think both theſe things to be true of us, without ſuppoſing us to believe both parts of a contradiction at once. But whatever he himſelf may be able to do as to believing of contradictions, he is greatly miſtaken if he think that we have ſo ſtrong a Faith, or ſo wide a Swallow. For we that know our ſelves much better than he doth, declare ſincerely that we were never Maſters of ſuch a Faith as can believe known contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that we could never make both ends of a contradiction meet, ſo as to be able to ſwallow them down both at once. Either then our Author knew that the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> deny Original ſin and univerſal Redemption, or he knew it not; if he <hi>knew</hi> that they deny both, how can he be excuſed from <hi>lying againſt his Conſcience,</hi> in telling the World in Print ſuch a known untruth and contradictious falſhood, that we are <hi>Middle-way-men,</hi> and that <hi>our cauſe is Coincident with that of Pelagius,</hi> that is, that we are for <hi>the middle-way and the extreme way,</hi> for the middle-way and not for the middle-way at the ſame time. But if he <hi>knew not</hi> what the cauſe of <hi>Pelagius</hi> was and is, with <hi>what Faith and Conſcience</hi> could he ſay that <hi>our cauſe is Coincident, or is the ſame, with the cauſe of</hi> Pelagius? Is it lawful for him, and his <hi>judicious Obſervers</hi> to defame the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93177:100"/>Miniſters of Chriſt, and to charge them with <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie, and Confederacy with <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereticks, when they do not well know what the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was? Hath <hi>our Author</hi> a priviledge boldly to affirm what he doth not know nor underſtand? And is he fit to inform the people of that which he is ignorant of, and wherein he needs to be informed himſelf? We expect the People, for whoſe Information, he pretends to write, will be more juſt and reaſonable than to believe the <hi>Calumnies</hi> wherewith this man either <hi>maliciouſly</hi> or <hi>ignorantly</hi> aſperſes us; eſpecially when they may clearly ſee that his Calumnies do not hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but are inconſiſtent, and contradict one another; which is a ſure mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know a <hi>Calumniator</hi> and <hi>falſe witneſs; Mark</hi> 14.56. We do not poſitively ſay that he doth thus calumniate us out of <hi>meer malice,</hi> but we are ſure it is and muſt be either out of <hi>malice or ignorance;</hi> and we willingly incline to the more charitable (which is the ſafer) ſide, that he doth it rather out of pure <hi>ignorance and blind zeal,</hi> than out of meer malice, and <hi>Cain-like</hi> hatred of his Brethren. But whatever moved him to it, the thing it ſelf is unwarrantable and injurious, for which he muſt give an account to that God who is an infinitely more <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſerver</hi> than he or any of his party; and who, as he <hi>obſerves</hi> all our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices, ſo he judges always aright according to the true merits of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe; and in this cauſe we can with a good conſcience lift up our face to the Lord our God and ſay, Lord, thou whoſe underſtanding is infinite, and from whom nothing can be hid, and who haſt infinite power and right to puniſh us with everlaſting deſtruction, if we now lye to thee, and diſſemble with thee, thou knoweſt that our cauſe is <hi>not Coincident with the cauſe of Pelagius;</hi> and that this man doth <hi>Calumniate</hi> us in ſaying that <hi>judicious Obſervers cannot but perceive that they are coincident.</hi> To thee, O God, we appeal from this <hi>falſe Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> and unto thee we referr our cauſe, to judge between us and this man, whether it be coincident, or the ſame with that of <hi>Pelagius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be <hi>our Author</hi> will object and ſay, That if our cauſe be not coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with that of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> yet it is at leaſt coincident with that of <hi>Arminius.</hi> We anſwer, that neither is that true.</p>
               <p>For (1.) Our Author and thoſe of his way, commonly ſay, that the cauſe of <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> is <hi>all one,</hi> and therefore if they ſay true in that, and do not calumniate <hi>Arminius,</hi> our cauſe cannot poſſibly be coincident with the cauſe of <hi>Arminius,</hi> unleſs it be alſo coincident with that of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> they being both one and the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Our Author ſaith, That we are for the <hi>middle-way,</hi> between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> as he calls them: If that be true, our cauſe muſt lye in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> between the two extremes, and then it is impoſſible to be <hi>Coincident</hi> with the cauſe of <hi>Arminius,</hi> for that is <hi>one of the extremes;</hi> and it is evident by ocular demonſtration that the <hi>middle</hi> cannot be the ſame with either of the <hi>ſides,</hi> and ſo cannot be coincident with either of the <hi>extremes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>our Author</hi> ſay, that we are come off from the <hi>middle</hi>-way, and are come over to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and ſo are now on the other <hi>extreme,</hi> and wrong ſide, in oppoſition to the Orthodox, who are on the extreme right ſide.</p>
               <p>We Anſwer (1.) If that be true, and he know it, then he is guilty of a groſs lye, in ſaying that our cauſe is coincident with that of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and ſo that we are <hi>Arminians,</hi> and yet that we are for a <hi>middle</hi>-way between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> If he will have us to be <hi>Arminians,</hi> he muſt not (if he be a true honeſt man) ſay that we are for a <hi>middle-way</hi> between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If we be come over from the middle-way unto the <hi>Arminian</hi> extreme, we deſire our Author to tell us <hi>when</hi> it was, and <hi>how long</hi> it is ſince, and <hi>how</hi> he knows that we are come over to the <hi>Arminian</hi> extreme; for we profeſs ſincerely that we know none of theſe things: We neither know <hi>when</hi> it was, nor <hi>how long</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:93177:101"/>it is ſince, nor do we know that we are yet come over, or <hi>ever ſhall come over to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian extreme.</hi> Indeed we dare not pretend to any certain Knowledge of Future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents, that are not revealed to us; yet we truſt in our God through Jeſus Chriſt, that by the Grace of his Spirit, he will keep us ſo firm and fixed in the Truth of his Word, that we ſhall <hi>never go over to the Arminian extream.</hi> And ſince we know certainly what <hi>we are</hi> for the preſent as to this matter, we can ſafely and with a good Conſcience call Heaven and Earth to Record this day againſt this <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> that we are <hi>not Arminians,</hi> and that he doth very ſinfully reproach and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate us in ſaying, that <hi>we corrupt Chriſts pure Goſpel, and obtrude on People a new Arminian Goſpel, to the certain Peril of their Souls; and that our Cauſe is Coincident with that of</hi> Arminius. But,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Though according to the Light, which God hath given us by his Word and Spirit, we believe that the <hi>Arminians</hi> erre from the Truth in many things, and we do from our Hearts diſſent from their Errours, yet we hold our ſelves bound in Conſcience, as we muſt anſwer to God at Death and Judgment, not to calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them nor any other Erroneous Brethren; and therefore we cannot in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſay, that whileſt the <hi>Arminians</hi> keep within the compaſs of <hi>the five Articles</hi> (wherein they differed from our Divines at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>) their cauſe is <hi>coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the cauſe of</hi> Pelagius. We do indeed think that ſomething and too much of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> or <hi>Semipelagianiſm</hi> is implied in, and by conſequence <hi>follows</hi> from their Principles; but that doth not make their cauſe to be <hi>Coincident</hi> with the cauſe of <hi>Pelagius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore our moſt Judicious and Conſciencious Divines do not ſcruple to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> to be a <hi>Hereſie,</hi> againſt the very Foundation of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But as for <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> keeping within the Compaſs of <hi>the five Articles,</hi> their Conſciences will not ſuffer them to ſay, that it is one or more <hi>Fundamental</hi> Errors, or <hi>Hereſies:</hi> this might be ſufficiently proved by many Teſtimonies of our Divines, but inſtead of all that might be alledged, we ſhall Content our ſelves at preſent with the Teſtimony of that famous <hi>General Aſſembly of the Church of</hi> Scotland; which in the Year 1638. at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> depoſed all their Biſhops; though that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had accuſed many of their Biſhops of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> yet did they not ſay, that <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> was as bad as, and <hi>Coincident</hi> with <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and that it was a <hi>Fundamental Hereſie:</hi> They were ſo far from ſaying ſo, that in the ſeventh Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>November</hi> 28. the Moderator Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> in the Face and with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Aſſembly, gave this Moderate Anſwer unto a Politick Objection of Dr. <hi>Balcanquel,</hi> who appeared there for the Biſhops, <hi>Controverſias omnes:</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That all the Controverſies (eſpecially if they exceed not the limits of the five controverted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) between the</hi> Arminians <hi>and</hi> Anti-Arminians <hi>or</hi> Calviniſts, <hi>neither were nor are about</hi> Fundamental Doctrines; <hi>that indeed the</hi> Arminians <hi>erred grievouſly, but that he and the Synod were not yet perſwaded, that all Heterodoxies, that is, that all Erroneous Doctrines,

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93177:101"/>his Way, to beware that from our alledging the Teſtimony of the Synod of <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> concerning the <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors, they do not increaſe their Jealouſie of us, as if we thereby ſhewed our love to and liking of <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi> for we ſincerely, profeſs, that though we have a real Love and Reſpect for the Perſons of ſome <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> whom we know, yet we have none at all for their <hi>Errors;</hi> but we do really hate their Errors, and all Errors wherever we diſcern them; and if we could diſcern any in our <hi>ſelves,</hi> there we ſhould hate them moſt of all, and renounce them with abhorrency.</p>
               <p>But though we ought to hate, and be zealous againſt all Error, whereſoever and in whomſoever; yet we ſhould do it with Judgment and Underſtanding, and our hatred of and zeal againſt Errors, ſhould bear a due Proportion to the real Greatneſs or Comparative Smalneſs of them; for if we do otherwiſe, and make no difference between Errors and Errors, but judge all to be alike fundamental and damnable; the natural Conſequence thereof will be this, that as ſoon as ever we apprehend, right or wrong, that any Chriſtian Brethren are fallen into an Error, we ſhall immediately damn their Perſons, and ſeparate our ſelves from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; which we take to be againſt the Rules of Chriſtianity, and highly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the common good of Chriſts Church, and to the particular good of our own Souls. Wherefore, as we have warned, ſo we adviſe <hi>our Author</hi> when at any time he apprehends any Brethren to be in an Error, that he would not preſently cry, Theſe men have got <hi>a new Goſpel,</hi> Away with them, <hi>Anathema</hi> to them; that is, let the curſe of God be upon them; but rather take time to conſider, whether it be really an Error, and if it be, whether it be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Error, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their glorifying God on Earth, and obtaining Salvation in Heaven: And if after he hath uſed the beſt means he can to inform himſelf, he cannot but think, that it is ſuch a great and damnable Hereſie; let him think alſo, whether he had not better endeavour to reclaim them by inſtructing them in meekneſs and love, than preſently to proclaim them to be curſed and <hi>damned Hereticks.</hi> And laſtly, if after he hath converſed with them, heard them ſpeak for themſelves, and found (it may be) that they have Arguments for their Opinion from Scripture and Reaſon, which he cannot eaſily and clearly Anſwer, it may not be amiſs for him to abate his Confidence, and to think ſoberly with himſelf, that the Errors of theſe men may not be ſo great and damnable, as he thought, nor the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo bad as he took them to be; but that for ought he knows to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they may be good People in the main, and ſuch as Chriſt himſelf will own (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their involuntary Errors) for true living Members of that Myſtical Body, whereof he is the Head and Saviour.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>our Authors</hi> alledging, that <hi>Bradwardin, Twiſs</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> are againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Arminius;</hi> it implies the foreſaid Calumny and falſe Accuſation, that we are <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and is grounded upon it, otherwiſe it is impertinent; for if we be (as we are) againſt <hi>Pelagius and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> as well as they, it makes nothing againſt, but for us, that they are againſt them likewiſe. Yet we muſt tell <hi>our Author</hi> what it may be he doth not know, that <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin</hi> and the <hi>Arminians</hi> agree in ſeveral of their Errors wherein we differ from and oppoſe them both; for inſtance, <hi>Bradwardin</hi> holds, that Chriſt died for and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed not only <hi>Sufficiently</hi> and <hi>Efficaciouſly</hi> alſo, many of the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> ſo that in the Viſible Church, many of them are through Chriſt made Effectually Partakers of Regenerating Juſtifying and Sanctifying Grace for a time, inſomuch that <hi>(quoad sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum praeſentis Juſtitiae) in reſpect of the preſent state of Juſtification,</hi> wherein they are, there is no intrinſecal difference between them and the regenerate juſtifyed Elect, but they always <hi>fall</hi> from that State of Grace or Juſtification totally, and finally, and are damned Eternally: The neceſſary Conſequence whereof is, that none of the Regenerate, Juſtified Elect, can be abſolutely ſure without a Miracle, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary immediate Revelation, that they ſhall not fall from Grace totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93177:102"/>and be damned too: For though they be never ſo ſure that there is a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change wrought in them, and that they are converted and juſtified, and in a State of Grace for the preſent, yet they can conclude nothing from that with an abſolute Certainty, that they are elected and ſhall perſevere to the end and be ſaved; becauſe all that Grace that they have for the preſent, is of the ſame common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that Grace which is in many Reprobates, and ſo the one may be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt for ought they can know to the contrary, as well as the other. Thus <hi>Bradwardin</hi> by holding the actual Juſtification and Sanctification of Reprobates, ſubverts the Doctrine of the Saints total and final <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in Grace, and Aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as ſhall be proved from his own Words, if our Author have the boldneſs to deny the matter of Fact. And now let him go and make his beſt of <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and tell the People what an Orthodox Defender of the Grace of God, he hath got for his ſecond againſt us, whom he hath highly provoked to the Combat, and neceſſitated to take Arms for our own Defence: For as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> ſaid of old, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus non eſt qui notam Haereſeos diſſimulat; He is no (good) Chriſtian, who ſuffers the black Mark of Hereſie to be ſet upon himſelf, and does not endeavour to wipe it off, and clear himſelf of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now at laſt it is like, <hi>our Author</hi> will ſay, that if we are neither <hi>Pelagians</hi> nor <hi>Arminians,</hi> yet we can never clear our ſelves of being <hi>Middle-way-men,</hi> and that here he hath us, and will hold us, and we ſhall never eſcape his Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>Whereunto we Anſwer, That according to the Deſcription, which he gives of a <hi>Middle-way-man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let.</hi> p. 2.</note> we may ſafely and with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience according to the Light which God hath given us, deny that we are <hi>Middle-way-men;</hi> for he makes a <hi>Middle-way-man</hi> to be one who eſpouſes, defends and promotes a <hi>Middle-way</hi> betwixt the <hi>Arminians</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> But that we are <hi>Middle-way-men</hi> in this Senſe, we muſt deny; for we cannot own our ſelves to be ſuch men without lying againſt our Conſciences, and ſaying, that we are <hi>not Orthodox,</hi> or but <hi>half-Orthodox,</hi> which we believe to be a great falſhood.</p>
               <p>If therefore our Author would have us to confeſs that we are <hi>Middle-way-men,</hi> (1.) He muſt give us a better and truer Definition of a <hi>Middle-way-man,</hi> for this will not fit us at all; belike he would have the World believe that we are <hi>half-Arminians</hi> and <hi>half-Orthodox;</hi> but if that be his meaning, in intimating that we ſteer a Middle-courſe between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and the Orthodox, it is an abominable Calumny which we have already wiped off, by ſolemnly and ſincerely Declaring that we do not participate of the <hi>Arminian</hi> extream at all, we are <hi>no Arminians in whole or in part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He would do well to tell us whom he means by the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> it may be that by the Orthodox, he means chiefly <hi>himſelf</hi> and his ſmall party, excluſively of all other Proteſtants. If that be his meaning; we ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That he muſt not thus <hi>beg,</hi> but <hi>prove</hi> his Orthodoxy, before we can own him to be thus very Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We think that ſuch a Notion of Orthodoxy is too narrow and <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> It is a Monopolizing of ſoundneſs in the Faith to a Party, and that <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> a ſmall Party of Chriſtians too; and a branding of all the reſt with the Mark of Unſound and Erroneous in the Faith: Whereas the real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe called <hi>Middle-way-men</hi> on the one ſide, and the moſt of thoſe <hi>called</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox on the other, may not be matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but rather matter of <hi>Opinion;</hi> and ſo both Parties may be <hi>Orthodox</hi> or <hi>ſound in the Faith:</hi> That is, notwithſtanding ſome different Sentiments in leſſer things, they may both firmly and fully agree in believing all the Articles of Chriſtian Faith, which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Church Communion on Earth, and to the obtaining Eternal Salvation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, through the Mercy of God the Father, the Merits and Satisfaction of the Son, and the Grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:93177:102"/>
               <p n="3">(3dly.) If he had ſhewed us in his Letter, wherein that <hi>Middle-way</hi> doth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly conſiſt, according to his Opinion; we ſhould have (it may be) either owned or diſowned it in part or in whole, according as we had found him to have truly repreſented or miſrepreſented it to the World. But ſince he hath not done that, we cannot know certainly what he means by that <hi>Middle-way</hi> he talks of.</p>
               <p n="4">(4thly.) Yet by ſome Paſſages in his Letter, we gueſs that he Points at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about <hi>the extent of Chriſts Death,</hi> which hath been amongſt Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſince the Reformation, or ſince the time that <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> began to write on that Head after the Reformation.</p>
               <p>And if that be the thing he Points at without naming it, we will, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Give the true State of the Controverſie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Declare briefly what our Opinion is, as to that matter. And for the State of the Controverſie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> There are ſome Divines in the World, who are ſaid to hold that Chriſt died <hi>equally</hi> for all men, Elect and Non-elect; and that God on the account of Chriſts Death, gives a common ſufficient Grace to them all, whereby they may all (if they will) apply to themſelves the Vertue of Chriſts Death, and thereby obtain Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation. But that Chriſt did <hi>not</hi> dye for the Elect, out of any <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love</hi> to them above others; and that God through Chriſt doth not give any <hi>Special Effectual, Determining Grace</hi> to the Elect more than to the Non-elect. This is the <hi>Arminian extream.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are other Divines, who hold that Chriſt died for the <hi>Elect only</hi> and <hi>excluſively of all others,</hi> and that he died <hi>not for any of the Non-elect in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tolerable true ſenſe;</hi> that he no more died for any of thoſe Men, who are not elected to Eternal Life, than he died for the <hi>Devil;</hi> and that ſuch Men have no more to do with the Satisfaction and Meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Chriſt, than the <hi>Devil</hi> hath. This is <hi>the other extream.</hi> And we ſuppoſe that this is that which <hi>our Author</hi> accounts the <hi>Orthodex</hi> ſide, and that he is of this ſide himſelf.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Between theſe two extream Opinions, there is a Golden mean, there is <hi>a Midd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e-way,</hi> which hath been many hundred years ago, and ſtill is expreſſed in this form of Words, That <hi>Chriſt died only for the Elect-Sinners of Mankind both Sufficiently and Efficaciouſly, but that he died for the Non-elect only Sufficiently but not Efficaciouſly.</hi> This is the State of the Controverſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It be now demanded Whether we be for this <hi>Middle-way</hi> or not? In Anſwer to that demand we ſay, That there are a great many of us, who are Calumniated by <hi>our Author</hi> as <hi>corrupters of the Goſpel,</hi> by holding a Conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and tho' we do not doubt, but we all agree in the foreſaid General form of Words, and in admitting the Diſtirction of Chriſts dying for <hi>the Elect Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,</hi> and for the <hi>Reprebate only Sufficiently;</hi> yet it may be, that when we come to explain what we particularly mean by Chriſts dying Sufficiently only for the Non-elect, there will be ſome little Difference amongſt us in ſome of our Notions and Expreſſions, and poſſibly ſome of us may not in effect differ from <hi>our Author,</hi> further than in the manner of our Expreſſion, and in the Method of our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Notions.</p>
               <p>But (1.) We are all of one Mind and of one Faith with reſpect to Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Efficaciouſly for the Elect only,</hi> and we hope alſo that <hi>our Author</hi> himſelf agrees with us herein: Which is <hi>the main thing</hi> wherein our Agreement is neceſſary. And then,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to the <hi>Non-Elect,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of them to whom the Goſpel is preached; we hope all of us do and will agree to this, That <hi>Chriſt died for them ſufficiently in ſuch a ſenſe as he did not dye for the fallen Angels, ſo that if they ſhould believe in Chriſt and repent of their ſins, as they are bound</hi> to do, <hi>according to the tenour and terms of the Goſpel, they ſhould be ſaved through Chriſt;</hi> and not periſh as they do by perſevering in Unbelief and Impenitence: And being thus far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93177:103"/>we hope we ſhall keep <hi>the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace;</hi> and as to any <hi>little</hi> difference of Judgment that may remain, we ſhall bear with one another in Love, after the example of the famous <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> whereof the Members differed in the Synod upon this very point, and yet they bore with one another, and wiſely agreed againſt the <hi>Arminian</hi> extreme, as moſt manifeſtly appears from the <hi>Acts</hi> of that <hi>Synod.</hi> And we would hope alſo that <hi>our Author</hi> and thoſe of his way, will not be againſt this mutual forbearance, when they conſider that the ſaid middle-way was not only <hi>tolerated</hi> but even <hi>approved</hi> by the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> in that the <hi>ſuffrages</hi> which expreſly aſſerted it, were <hi>approved;</hi> and that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was held by our <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> both at home and abroad. For inſtance, the Univerſality of Chriſts death in the ſenſe before explained, was believed and profeſſed by the Bleſſed Martyrs <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo by the Church of <hi>England</hi> her ſelf; and by <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> as ſhall be proved by their own words, to be ſeen in their writings extant at this day, if any have the conſidence to deny it. At preſent we ſhall only give our Brethren to underſtand, Firſt, That <hi>Luther</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever,</hi> &amp;c. ſays [<hi>Jam ſanè tibi &amp; omnibus hominibus fatendum eſt mundum,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Now truly, thou and all men muſt confeſs, that the whole race of Mankind is called the World, comprehending in one, all men in general and every man in particular; do'ſt thou believe therefore that thou art a man? or if thou canſt neither believe nor know that, put thy hand in thy boſome, or</hi> feel thy Noſe, <hi>make an experiment whether thou hast not all thy Members full of fleſh and blood, as other men? Wherefore then wouldſt thou exclude thy ſelf out of this word</hi> (World), <hi>ſince Chriſt expreſly declares that God did not ſend his Son to the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>only, nor gave him to</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>but to the World, that all might lay claim to him, even as many as are called the Sons of Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Calvin</hi> on 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. ſays, <hi>[Ego verum eſſe illud dictum fateor ſufficienter pro toto mundo paſſum eſſe Chriſtum, ſed pro electis tantum efficaciter.]</hi> 
                  <q>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that ſaying to be true, That Chriſt ſuffered ſufficiently for the whole World, but efficaciouſly for the Elect only.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And on <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>[Communem omnium gratiam fecit, quia omnibus expoſita eſt, non quod ad omnes extendatur reipſa, nam etſi paſſus eſt Chriſtus pro peccatis totius mundi, atque omnibus indifferenter Dei benignitate offertur, non tamen omnes apprehendunt.]</hi> 
                  <q>The Apoſtle (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) Makes Grace common to all Men, becauſe it is expoſed to all Men, not that it is really and effectually extended unto all. For tho Chriſt ſuffered for the ſins of <hi>the whole World,</hi> and through the goodneſs of God, he is indifferently offered unto all; yet <hi>all</hi> do not apprehend or receive him.</q> Here is that which is called <hi>the middle-way</hi> owned by <hi>Luther</hi> firſt, afterwards by <hi>Calvin</hi> as plainly as can be expreſſed in ſo few words. Whereupon we demand, Did our Firſt Reformers, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> by this, <hi>Corrupt the Old, and Preach a New Goſpel,</hi> or not? If they did <hi>corrupt the old true Goſpel,</hi> and preach a <hi>new falſe Goſpel,</hi> Then (1.) We owe no great thanks to them, or reſpect to their Memory, for their Service in Reforming the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If we grant this to be true of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> we betray the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yield to the Papiſts that which their hearts do moſt earneſtly deſire, that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> may be accounted Two <hi>Impoſtors</hi> and Deceivers, who deluded the People, corrupted the Chriſtian Religion, and Preached <hi>a new Goſpel</hi> to the World. For our parts, we dare not thus far betray the Proteſtant Cauſe to the Papiſts; rather than do ſo, we maintain that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> by holding <hi>univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſenſe explained,</hi> did not corrupt the Chriſtian Religion, nor preach a new Goſpel. And if <hi>they</hi> did not, then thoſe amongſt <hi>us</hi> who hold univerſal Redemption <hi>as they held it,</hi> do no more corrupt Religion, nor preach a new Goſpel than they did; and conſequently it is a vile <hi>Calumny and Reproach</hi> caſt upon us (and through us upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>We have been ſomething long in ſhewing the falſe-hood of our Authors firſt Calumny, and in wiping it off, becauſe it is <hi>general,</hi> and ſeems to <hi>comprehend</hi> or to be the <hi>ground</hi> of all the reſt that abound in his Letter. But for the reſt of them, ſince we have removed the grounds of them, by the account we have given of our principles in the points of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and of the <hi>extent of Chriſts death,</hi> they fall of themſelves, and light on the head of him that raiſed them; and therefore we ſhall not much trouble either our ſelves in refuting them, or others in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long Refutation of them.

                  <q>The righteouſneſs of Chriſt in his active and paſſive Obedience, hath been aſſerted by Proteſtant Divines, to be not only the procuring and meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, for this the Papiſts own; but the matter, as the Imputation of it is the form of our Juſtification.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here a groſs Calumny is implyed, <hi>to wit,</hi> that we differ not from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the point of Juſtification, and to make the ſimple people believe this, he gives them to underſtand that we hold Chriſts righteouſneſs to be only the procuring and meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, and that the <hi>Papists</hi> own this as well as we do; and conſequently that there is little or no difference between us and the Papiſts in the Fundamental point of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But that this is a Calumny doth appear by what we have ſaid before, when we ſhewed that Chriſts Righteouſneſs alone comes in the place of that perſonal perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs which was the condition of the firſt Covenant in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and of the law of Works, and by which perſonal Righteouſneſs, man was to have been juſtified according to that Covenant, if he had perfectly kept it, and had not fallen from his Innocency. There we ſhewed that, ſince no man in his lapſed ſtate hath or can have in himſelf that perſonal ſinleſs righteouſneſs; every man is to ſeek a righteouſneſs in Chriſt that may ſerve him for his Juſtification, inſtead of that which he ſhould have had in himſelf, but hath not; and he that ſeeks it in Chriſt, as he ought to do, will there find it: For Chriſt by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unto death, even the death of the Croſs, hath paid the full price of our Redemption, and by paying that price hath made full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for our ſins, and hath merited for us the full pardon of our ſins, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation of our Souls, if we ſincerely believe, repent, and obey the Goſpel, by that Grace which he hath alſo purchaſed for us by his blood, promiſed to us in his Word, and gives unto us by his Spirit. So that we are <hi>compleat in him</hi> who is our head, our living and life-giving head, <hi>in whom it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell,</hi> that out of his <hi>fulneſs we might receive, and grace for grace.</hi> Now will any man of Conſcience, who hath a competent Underſtanding of the controverſies between us and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſay, that <hi>they</hi> give as much to Chriſt in the point of the Juſtification of a Sinner, as here we do, and ever did? We aſcribe <hi>all ſatisfaction for ſin</hi> both with reſpect to eternal and temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.

We think no Proteſtant, eſpecially that is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Chriſts Goſpel, will be ſo <hi>impudent</hi> or ſo far imitate the <hi>Father of Lyes,</hi> as to affirm theſe things to be true, which all the World know or may know to be notoriouſly falſe.</p>

                     <hi>Turret.

                  <q>Yea but, or ſurely, we would have no other thing, (but what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath here granted us) for as to that which he adds, that we would have Chriſts Rigteouſneſs ſo imputed to us, that by it we may be denominated and may be <hi>formally Righteous,</hi> he ſuppoſeth it without proof, and falſely, upon their perverſe and prepoſterous Hypotheſis concerning a moral Juſtification.</q> Thus <hi>Turretin</hi> writes of the Conceſſion and Confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other Papiſts. Then he proceeds to ſhew that notwithſtanding thoſe good words of theirs whereby they ſeem to come over to us, yet they and we are never the nearer, but remain at as great diſtance as before, becauſe by <hi>Gods imputing to us Chriſts merits in order to Juſtification,</hi> they mean that for the ſake of Chriſts merits imputed to us, <hi>God infuſes Grace into us, by which infuſed Grace it is that we are juſtified according to their principles.</hi> 
                  <q>Whereas we hold that Chriſts merits are ſo imputed and communicated to us, <hi>(ut ſint cauſa meritoria ſola noſirae juſtificationis, nec ulla alia detur juſtitia propter quam abſolvimur in conſpectu dei,)</hi> that they are the alone meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, neither is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Righteouſneſs for which we are abſolved in the ſight of God.</q> Thus <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retin</hi> ſhews that notwithſtanding the <hi>ſeeming</hi> agreement between Proteſtants and Papiſts in the point of Juſtification, yet the reall difference remains ſtill. But how doth he ſhew it? Doth he ſhew the difference by denying that Chriſts Righteoſneſs is the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification, becauſe the Papiſts affirm it to be ſo in ſome ſenſe? No, no, <hi>Turretin</hi> hath left that unto <hi>our Author</hi> to do, if he pleaſe; but he ſhews that there is a great difference in the point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between us and them.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In that we hold Chriſts Righteouſneſs to be the meritorious cauſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in another ſenſe, than they hold it ſo to be.</p>

               <p>HIS Fourth Calumny is, that we teach ſuch Doctrine in the point of Juſtification, as <hi>neither we our ſelves nor any other ſenſible man dare stand to at Death.</hi> This is to be ſeen in the 18th and 19th pages of his Letter.</p>
               <p>If this were true, we confeſs it might juſtly prejudice People againſt our Doctrine; and give them and our ſelves too cauſe enough to ſuſpect it to be falſe. But this is like the reſt, utterly falſe, and contrary to Experience. For our Doctrine is (as we have ſaid often) that Chriſts moſt perfect, ſatisfactory, Meritorious Righteouſneſs, is to us and all that are ſaved, inſtead of that perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs which we ought to have had in our ſelves, but ſince the fall neither have nor can have; and that <hi>by and for the ſaid Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone,</hi> we are <hi>juſtified</hi> from the guilt of all our ſins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, Original and Actual, and are accepted as Righteous before God, and receive a Right and Title to Eternal Life: This is the <hi>only</hi> Righteouſneſs which we cruſt to as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification; this Righteouſneſs we hold to be given unto us, if through Grace we ſincerely believe in Chriſt and repent of our ſins; and that on the account of this Righteouſneſs we ſhall obtain eternal Life and Salvation, if through Grace we perſevere to the end in Faith and Repentance, and in leading a holy Life, as was before explained: But on the contrary we maintain, that the forſaid Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not given to any for their actual Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before they firſt through Grace ſincerely believe and repent; and that none ſhall obtain eternal Life and Salvation on the account of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, but thoſe who after they have firſt believed and repented, do not Apoſtatize either totally or finally, but in oppoſition to ſuch Apoſtacy, perſevere in Faith repentance and holy Goſpel-obedience unto Death. This is the ſumm and <hi>ſubstance of our whole Doctrine in the point of Juſtification.</hi> Now why we or any ſincere Chriſtan ſhould be afraid to <hi>ſtand to</hi> this Doctrine at the <hi>hour of death</hi> and in the day of Judgment, it is above our Capacity to underſtand; for this is the Doctrine which the Lord himſelf hath taught us by his holy Spirit in the Canonical Scriptures: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93177:105"/>if the Scriptures be true, this Doctrine cannot be falſe, but is and muſt be true; and it is very ſtrange and wonderful, if all true Chriſtians be afraid to dye in the Faith of the true Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>We rather think, that if they be not delirious, but have the uſe of their Reaſon, they are not true Chriſtians, but meer <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that renounce the foreſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification, and are afraid to ſtand to it at Death.</p>
               <p>We are ſure that good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was <hi>not afraid to ſtand to this Doctrine,</hi> when he juſtly apprehended himſelf to be under the Sentence of <hi>Death,</hi> ſince we find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3, 4. That he prayed thus unto the Lord, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And God was ſo far from being diſpleaſed with this his Prayer, that he moſt graciouſly accepted it, and ſhewed himſelf ſo well pleaſed with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he gave him a further Leaſe of his Life for fifteen years, and Sealed the Leaſe with a Miracle; a thing we do not find that ever the Lord did for any other Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince. We have alſo read of many in Hiſtory, and have heard of others, and have our ſelves known ſome, who have not been afraid to <hi>ſtand to our Doctrine</hi> aforeſaid <hi>at Death;</hi> but have died comfortably in the Faith of it: As for our ſelves we <hi>live</hi> in the Faith of it, and deſire to <hi>die</hi> alſo in the Faith of it; and as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it our Duty, to ſtand to it in Life and at Death; ſo we truſt and hope that (if the Lord be pleaſed to preſerve to us the uſe of our Reaſon, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to us the Preſence of his Spirit and Aſſiſtance of his Grace) we ſhall be enabled to perform our Duty in owning at <hi>Death;</hi> and if he call us to it, in <hi>Sealing with our Blood</hi> the ſaid true Doctrine of Juſtification, which we have preached to his People in the time of our Life. As for our Author, we hope he agrees with us, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is never to be renounced, but always to be truſted to and relied upon, as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification and Salvation, both in Life and at Death: What then would he have us to <hi>renounce?</hi> If it be our own <hi>Merits,</hi> he knows very well, that we admit not the very poſſibility of any proper <hi>Merits</hi> of our own, and that we renounce all Confidence in ſuch a Chimera, as much <hi>as he or any Man can do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be <hi>our own good Acts or Works</hi> as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification: He may know by what we have ſaid before, that we <hi>renounce as much</hi> as he doth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>more</hi> too, all cauſal Influence of any good Acts or Works of ours upon Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. If it be <hi>Faiths</hi> being the <hi>Condition</hi> of Juſtification, that he would have us to renounce: <hi>That we can never do</hi> either in Life or at Death, for the Reaſons we have given before. Beſides, <hi>he</hi> himſelf aſcribes <hi>as much,</hi> and we think <hi>ſomething more to Faith</hi> in the matter of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> than <hi>we</hi> do; for <hi>he</hi> maintains <hi>Faith,</hi> to be the <hi>Inſtrument of Juſtification,</hi> and if it be <hi>a proper Inſtrument,</hi> it muſt have an <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſality</hi> upon Juſtification, and ſo muſt be an <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> and to be an <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> is more than to be a <hi>Receptive Condition</hi> of Juſtification: If we may be afraid then to ſtand to it at Death, that Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of Juſtification, <hi>he</hi> may have more Cauſe to be afraid to ſtand to it at Death, that Faith is the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But we ſuſpect his meaning is, that we will and muſt be afraid to ſtand to it at Death, that <hi>Repentance</hi> is a Condition neceſſary to Juſtification; and that <hi>perſeverance</hi> in Faith, and in the Practice of Repentance and Holineſs, is neceſſary to the obtaining Poſſeſſion of Eternal Salvation: and if <hi>this</hi> be it indeed, which he thinks we and all ſenſible men muſt be <hi>afraid to ſtand to at Death,</hi> and therefore muſt renounce, we cannot but judge the Man to be under <hi>a ſtrong Deluſion:</hi> for <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as full and clear for the Truth of theſe things, as it is for the Truth of any other Article of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the Concurrent Judgment of Divines both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, agreeing with us in the ſame Truth, as we have proved at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have heard of many, and have known ſome who upon their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed have bitterly lamented and bewailed, that they had <hi>not repented</hi> of their Sins in time, that for and through the Meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they might have obtained Pardon and Juſtification; but we never heard of or knew any, who upon their Death-bed lamented and bewailed that they <hi>had repented</hi> too ſoon in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their obtaining Pardon and Juſtification through Chriſts Meritorious Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The like we may ſay of the Neceſſity of a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> in Order to the obtaining of Eternal Salvation through Chriſt; many have moſt lamentably bewailed on their Death-bed their own Folly and Wickedneſs in not preparing themſelves for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by the Practice of <hi>Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> But we could never hear of any who on their <hi>Death-bed</hi> lamented and bewailed that they had held the Erroneous Opinion, that the <hi>ſincere Practice of Holineſs is neceſſary to the obtaining of Salvation</hi> and Happineſs through the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. On the contrary, the Generality of People that are ſerious and ſenſible, they then acknowledge the Neceſſity of ſincere <hi>Repentance</hi> in Order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardon of Sin, and the Neceſſity of Holineſs, in Order to the obtaining of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Happineſs through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. So abominably falſe is it, that <hi>no ſenſible man dare ſtand to our Doctrine at his Death,</hi> that the quite contrary is true, and <hi>no knowing ſenſible Man but will gladly ſtand to it</hi> and own it with all his Heart; except ſuch <hi>Nominal Chriſtians</hi> as are Conſcious to themſelves, that they are <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and unconverted Sinners, and fear that if the Goſpel be true, they ſhall certainly be damned: And therefore they may poſſibly (ſome of them at leaſt) flatter themſelves with the Hopes that God for Chriſts ſake will Pardon and Juſtifie them <hi>before and without Repentance,</hi> and ſave them without Holineſs.</p>
               <p>But we dare not <hi>humour</hi> ſuch People, nor flatter them, however they may flatter themſelves, and therefore we muſt in faithfulneſs to Peoples Souls tell them from God, that <hi>except they repent they ſhall periſh;</hi> and that <hi>without Holineſs they ſhall never ſee the Lord,</hi> ſo as to be Happy in the ſight of him: And for the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> Hope of being <hi>pardoned without Repentance,</hi> and of being Happy without being Holy, it ſhall certainly periſh with himſelf: <hi>His Hope ſhall be cut off, and his truſt ſhall be as a Spiders Web.

               <p>Be it known then unto all men, That (1.) we do not ſay, nor ever did ſay, that the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Moral Law is <hi>repealed,</hi> ſo that no man is now under it, either to be <hi>condemned for breaking it,</hi> or to be <hi>ſaved by keeping it.</hi> (2.) We do not ſay, nor ever did ſay, that the Moral Law doth not now require <hi>perfect holineſs:</hi> On the contrary we confeſs with our mouths, and declare to the World, what we have ever believed, and do ſtill believe with our hearts,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the Moral Law doth now require of all men <hi>moſt perfect holineſs</hi> and ſinleſs obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That all Unconverted Impenitent Unbelievers whilſt they continue ſuch, are under <hi>the penal Sanction of the Moral Law,</hi> they are under its <hi>Curſe and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> John 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> He is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>in Law;</hi> though the Laws condemnatory Sentence is not yet <hi>executed</hi> upon him. But as many as refuſe and neglect to uſe the remedy provided in the Goſpel, and ſo doing, live and dy in Unbelief and impenitence, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be executively condemned for <hi>breaking the Law;</hi> and moreover having heard the Goſpel preached to them, and having had in the Goſpel a Soveraign Remedy offered them againſt the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, they ſhall be condemned likewiſe for refuſing or neglecting to <hi>uſe the ſaid Remedy; Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22.24. So that profeſſed Chriſtians who live and dy in impenitence and unbelief will be <hi>doubly</hi> condemned both by Law and Goſpel;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</note> whereas Heathens who never heard nor could hear of the Goſpel for want of an objective Revelation of it, they living and dying without Repentance and Faith in the true God, under the guilt of Sins againſt the Law and Light of Nature, will be condemned by the Law, but not by the Goſpel, which they could not know; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Since we believe that all Unconverted Impenitent Unblievers who live and dye in that State, are ſo under the ſanction of the Moral Law, as that they are to be condemned for breaking it, we cannot believe that the ſame Perſons are ſo under the ſanction of the moral Law, as that they are <hi>not to be condemned,</hi> but to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by keeping it: For that were to believe a contradiction, which we have not faith enough to do. Yet,</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) If the caſe be put <hi>disjunctively,</hi> as our Author expreſly puts it in his Letter, we maintain that what he charges upon us is notoriouſly <hi>falſe;</hi> and its contradictory is true, to wit, <hi>the ſanction of Gods moral Law is not repealed, ſo that no man is now under it, either to be condemned for breaking it, or to be ſaved by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</hi> We firmly believe that this <hi>disjunctive</hi> is true, <hi>Some men are now under the ſanction of the Law, either to be condemned for breaking it, or to be ſaved by keeping it.</hi> But take the <hi>latter part</hi> of the ſaid disjunctive <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> and underſtand it <hi>determinately,</hi> then we cannot believe it to be true, we cannot believe that <hi>ſome men are under the ſanction of the Law to be ſaved by keeping it,</hi> becauſe it is notoriouſly falſe.</p>
               <p>And that (1.) Becauſe no meer man ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath kept, doth keep, or ever will keep the Law ſo perfectly as never to ſin againſt it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to fall under the condemnation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe that Holy Scripture aſſures us, that <hi>if Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21. And that <hi>if there had been a Law given, which could have given Life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that believe,</hi> Gal. 3.21, 22. And again that <hi>what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> by a Sacrifice for Sin, <hi>condemned ſin in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.3.</p>
               <p>This is our Judgment concerning the <hi>Law and its Sanction,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Unconverted Impenitent Unbelievers,</hi> that ſo live and dye, they are under it, to be <hi>condemned,</hi> but not to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by it.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:93177:107"/>
               <p>Then for <hi>Converted Penitent Believers,</hi> who are in Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, and walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit; we believe that they <hi>are under the Law</hi> and <hi>not under the Law</hi> in different reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) They are under Gods Moral Law as it is a <hi>rule of Life,</hi> repreſenting to them what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God; and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what to do, and what not to do, that they may pleaſe God in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) They are under it alſo as it is a Law obliging them to <hi>moſt perfect and ſinleſs obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) They are under it as a Law <hi>forbidding</hi> all their <hi>ſins,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> all their <hi>ſins,</hi> but they are not under it as a Law by its Minatory Sanction <hi>condemning their Perſons</hi> which are <hi>in Chriſt</hi> by Faith, and <hi>walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> for <hi>there is no condemnation to ſuch,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) They are not <hi>under the Law as a Covenant of Works to be juſtified and ſaved by it.</hi> Becauſe none can be juſtified and ſaved by the Law conſidered as it was <hi>a Covenant of Works</hi> given to man in the ſtate of innocency, but thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly keep it and never once tranſgreſs it, either by Original or Actual Sin. But that is impoſſible for any meer man to do, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is not only <hi>Morally impoſſible,</hi> but it is <hi>Phyſically impoſſible,</hi> yea it is <hi>Metaphyſically impoſſible,</hi> that is, it is ſo abſolutely impoſſible that it implies a contradiction, and can be done by no power Moral, Natural, or Supernatural, by no power Human or Divine: For all meer Men without exception have <hi>already broken</hi> Gods Law, ſo as that they are guilty of death for the breach of it: And that which hath already <hi>been,</hi> cannot poſſibly by any power whatſoever, be made not to have been; as it implies a contradiction and is abſolutely impoſſible that the ſame thing ſhould be, and not be at the ſame time, ſo it implies a contradiction and is abſolutely impoſſible that the ſame thing ſhould have been and not have been, or ſhould be paſt and not be paſt at the ſame time. But it is a thing already paſt and true, that all Converted Penitent Believers have already broken Gods Law, and fallen under the condemnation of it, thefore it implies a contradiction and is abſolutely impoſſible now, that they <hi>have kept it</hi> ſo as never once to tranſgreſs it; and conſequently it implies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and is abſolutely impoſſible that they ſhould be now juſtified and ſaved by the Law which they have broken, and which for that reaſon would certainly condemn them, were it not that Chriſt hath Redeemed them from its condemnation, and by the Law of Faith abſolves and forgives them.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſhewed how true penitent Believers are under the Law and not under the Law, and how it hath loſt its Sanction, with reſpect to their Perſons: It hath loſt its <hi>Promiſſory Sanction</hi> by reaſon of their Sins, and through their own fault: But its <hi>Minatory Sanction,</hi> whereby it bound them over to condemnation for their ſins, is taken away from it <hi>(with reſpect to Penitent Believers who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit)</hi> by the Rich Mercy and Free Grace of God through the Satisfaction and Merits Chriſts obedience unto death, even the death of the Croſs. Now from the Premiſes it is as clear as the light at Noon-day, that we do not ſay, as is pretended, that the <hi>Sanction of the Law is repealed,</hi> ſo that <hi>no man is now under it, either to be condemned for breaking it, or to be ſaved by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</hi> So much for wiping off the Calumny which reſpects matter of <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next which reſpects matter of <hi>Practice,</hi> is that we <hi>have much kindneſs for true Antinomians in practice.</hi> This being matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and inſinuating into the People that we do not walk according to the Rules of the Goſpel, it ſhould have been proved by ſufficient evidence, before it had been thus charged publickly on Miniſters or People. But that is not <hi>our Authors</hi> way to bring <hi>evidence</hi> for the proof of his accuſations; but boldly to accuſe without proof: Whether the matter be true or falſe, it ſeems, is all one to him; for he is well acquainted with that, <hi>Calumniare audacter; aliquid adhaerebit, throw abundance of dirt,</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:93177:108"/>and in all probability ſome of it <hi>will ſtick.</hi> Well, but what is become of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> in the mean time? It ſeems little of that is to be expected from ſome men.</p>
               <p>As for our having <hi>much kindneſs for true Antinomians in practice;</hi> if he mean that we have much <hi>unlawful</hi> kindneſs for them, it is more than we know of our ſelves; and how he ſhould know that of us, which we do not know of our ſelves, we cannot underſtand.</p>
               <p>But there being many of us who are thus accuſed, we freely acknowledge that it may be ſome of us have ſome Acquaintance and Hearers who are in ſome reſpect <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> in practice, and that for ſuch ſinful Perſons we have much <hi>civil kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Compaſſion;</hi> and by a kind and compaſſionate behaviour towards them, we deſire and endeavour to gain them to Chriſt, and to Convert them from their ſinful practices; where is the evil of this? what rule of the Goſpel do we tranſgreſs by this? We think we are obliged both by the Law of Nature, and by the Law of God, thus to be kind to them, ſo long as there is any hope of gaining them. But if <hi>our Author</hi> mean, that we have much kindneſs for their <hi>Antinomian and Sinfull practices,</hi> or that we encourage them in ſuch practices, and do not endeavour to turn them from them; it is utterly <hi>falſe:</hi> And the Lord knows that the contrary is true, and that it is to ſome of us matter of much grief and ſorrow of heart, that they take ſuch courſes as are both diſpeaſing and diſhonourable to God, and deſtructive to their own Souls; that we uſe means to reclaim them, that we moſt frequently and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek God for them, and as it were travel in Birth untill Chriſt be formed in them. This is the <hi>greateſt kindneſs</hi> that we ſhew unto any who are true <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> in practice. And now let all who fear God, Judge, and even let <hi>our Authors</hi> own Conſcience, Judge, whether for this we deſerve to be thus reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and Calumniated.</p>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is not true, but falſe, that the Brethren, are for a <hi>new ſort of Divinity,</hi> and deſpiſe or neglect the <hi>Old:</hi> The falſhood of this hath been already fully and clearly demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.)

            <head>CHAP. V. <hi>VVhere People are adviſed to try before they truſt, and not ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed upon, and led into Error by the bold unproved Aſſertions and Dictates of</hi> any Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Writers <hi>whatſoever.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR our parts we neither have, nor deſire to have <hi>Dominion</hi> over Peoples <hi>Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. And therefore we do not deſire that any man ſhould believe us and be of our Judgment, any further than what we ſay or write is agreeable to Holy Scripture, and to right Reaſon grounded upon Scripture. In thoſe things wherein we affirm that <hi>our Author</hi> hath erred from the Truth, we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove by clear Scripture, and plain Reaſon conſonant to Scripture, that he hath ſo erred: And before People poſitively conclude that we are in the right, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to weigh and conſider well what we have written to prove the Truth of our Aſſertions; and after due conſideration, to judge according to the evidence of our proofs, as they will anſwer to God and their own Conſciences. If we have clearly and faithfully declared to people, the Mind and Will of God, as it is revealed by holy Scripture; though we do not deſire that they ſhould ſubmit their Judgments to us, and believe what we believe, meerly becauſe we believe it; yet we do expect that they ſhould ſubmit their Judgments unto God, as we have done: And that they ſhould believe what we believe, becauſe God hath revealed the matter of our belief, both to us and them. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall either neglect or refuſe to ſubmit their Judgments unto God, and to believe what they know or may eaſily know, he hath revealed, will be found guilty before the Lord, of unbelief and Spiritual pride, for which he will one day call them to an account.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if any think and affirm that we are miſtaken in our Judgment of the things in controverſie, and that therefore they are not bound with us to believe them: To ſuch we ſay, that if in any of them, we are miſtaken, it is more than we know, and our miſtake is altogether involuntary; for the Lord knows that we have diligently ſearched for the Truth, as to all the matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93177:109"/>with an earneſt deſire to find it, and with frequent and fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the God of Truth, that he would teach us the Truth; that by his Spirit of Truth, according to his Word of Truth, he would lead us into the Truth of thoſe Matters. And we are fully perſwaded in our own Minds, that God hath heard our Prayers, bleſſed our Endeavours, and cauſed us to find the Truth, which we have diligently ſought and ſearched for. We have alſo given the World an account of the Grounds and Reaſons of this our Perſwaſion, which we ſubmit to the impartial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of all that fear the Lord, and are ſincere Lovers of Truth; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that Perſons ſo well diſpoſed will find upon impartial Examination of the matters in Controverſie, that our Grounds are ſolid, and our Reaſons Cogent and Concluſive.</p>
            <p>Yet if in any one thing, we ſhould happen to be miſtaken, (which we believe we are not), we declare, that we are ſo far from deſiring any to follow us in that miſtake, and to believe any thing in matters of Doctrine, which God hath not revealed; that on the contrary, we ſhall through Grace be really thankful, firſt to God, and next to ſuch men as ſhall convince us of our miſtake by Evidence of Scripture, or by Right Reaſon, without Railing and Scolding. As for thoſe who have accuſtomed themſelves unto that way of Writing, let them not think that ever they ſhall be able to move us from our Perſwaſion, by Railing at us and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us Hereticks; If any attack us with ſuch Carnal Weapons, they will bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their own Weakneſs and Folly, and we hope, it ſhall have no other effect upon us, but to move us to pity them, and to pray the Lord to make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>It is not any mans bare thinking, or <hi>bold ſaying</hi> that we are miſtaken and preach a <hi>new Goſpel,</hi> that can make it to be true, or prove that it is ſo. The Nature of things are not ſo ſoon changed; no, things will ſtill remain to be what they are though weak paſſionate Men ſhould never ſo often think and boldly ſay that they are not what they are; that which is once true, will ſtill remain true, though men think and ſay ten thouſand times over, that it is falſe. As on the contrary, that which is once falſe (as it is <hi>moſt falſe</hi> that we preach <hi>a new Goſpel),</hi> will ſtill remain falſe, though <hi>our Author</hi> and his whole party, ſhould ten thouſand times over both think and ſay, and ſwear too, that it is true.</p>
            <p>We therefore beſeech all Chriſtian People, neither to believe <hi>our Author</hi> nor <hi>Us</hi> upon our <hi>bare Words;</hi> he confidently affirms, that we preach a new Goſpel: We deny it, he brings no proof, but his own reproachful Word for what he ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: We bring Scripture, Reaſon, and the Teſtimonies of Ancient Fathers, and Modern Divines for what we ſay againſt him, in Vindication of our own Innocency, and for Proof, that the Goſpel which we preach, is no other than the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel of Chriſt, which always hath been, now is, and ever will be preſerved in the Chriſtian Church to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Now we adviſe People not to truſt either <hi>him</hi> or <hi>us</hi> without Tryal, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what is ſaid on both ſides; and then to truſt thoſe whom they find upon Tryal to be moſt truſty, and to have given the beſt Reaſons, why they ſhould be truſted in theſe Matters. Conſider Chriſtians! what our moſt bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. <hi>That if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch.</hi> It will not excuſe People before God, that they followed their Leaders; for they are rational Creatures, and they ought to ſee with their own Eyes, and not to follow their Miniſters <hi>blindly,</hi> without conſidering and knowing whether they lead them right or wrong, whether they lead them in the way of Error, or in the way of Truth. Therefore our Saviour ſaith again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Take heed that no
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93177:110"/>Man deceive you.</hi> The like Advice our Lords great Apoſtle gave unto the Churches to whom he wrote his Epiſtles. <hi>Let no Man</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>deceive you with vain Words,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6.) This Advice he gave with reſpect to ſome of the things, that are controverted amongſt us at this Day. And again, <hi>Let no Man deceive you by any means.</hi> (2 Theſ. 2.3.) And as a Preſervative and Antidote againſt being deceived, he exhorted them to <hi>prove all things, and to hold faſt that which is good,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.)</p>
            <p>Moreover, though he was extraordinarily aſſiſted by an infallible Spirit, yet he commended the <hi>Bereans</hi> as People of a noble generous Mind, for trying his own Doctrine by the Touchſtone of Holy Scripture before they believed it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. It was not any ſlowneſs in them to believe, which made them examine his Doctrine, but it was Wiſdom and Prudence; for the Scripture ſaith, they received the Word <hi>with all Readineſs of Mind,</hi> and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo; they received readily, and yet ſearched diligently, making no more haſte than good ſpeed; and by ſearching they found all that <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them to be according to the Scripture, therefore they believed his Doctrine, and believed in Chriſt according to his Doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. And this was it which <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them for, that though he was an Apoſtle, inſpired with a Spirit of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, and could, and did Work Miracles to confirm the Truth of his Doctrine, yet they ſearched the Scriptures daily, to ſee whether his Doctrine was according to the Scriptures, before they believed it: and when by ſearching they found it to be all according to the Scriptures, they immediately believed and readily receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, for that very Reaſon, becauſe it was according to the Scriptures of Truth. And <hi>Paul</hi> was of ſuch an excellent Spirit, that if the <hi>Bereans</hi> or any other People had by diligent ſearch found any part of his Doctrine to be really contrary unto the Scriptures of Truth (which was impoſſible for them to do), he would have commended them alſo for not believing it, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25, 40. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Yea our bleſſed Lord himſelf when he was on Earth in his State of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a Man, and Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the Truth of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Promiſes made unto the Fathers, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.) He did not deſire that his Hearers ſhould believe him upon his bare Word, <hi>John</hi> 5.31. <hi>If I bear Witneſs of my ſelf, my Witneſs is not true:</hi> That is, though it be never ſo true in it ſelf, yet it is not true with reſpect <hi>to you,</hi> or it doth not <hi>appear</hi> true and convincing to you; therefore, as we read in that Chapter and elſewhere, our Lord (over and beſides his own Verbal Teſtimony) uſed to prove the Truth of his Doctrine by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to confirm it by ſuch miraculous Works, as could not be done but by the infinite Power of God, who neither would nor could give his Seal to ratifie and confirm a lie. And thereupon he ſaid unto the unbelieving Jews, <hi>John</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father, believe me not, but if I do, though ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe the Works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when convinced by the Notorlety of the Matters of Fact, that he did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works above the Power of Man; they were forced by the Evidence of common Senſe and Reaſon to confeſs it; yet being unwilling to believe in him on that account, they found out a way to elude the force of his Argument deduced from his Miracles, by raiſing a diſpute about the inviſible Secret cauſe of them; and by blaſphemouſly aſcribing them to the Devil and not to God, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.22.): He did not in Anſwer to that blaſphemous Cavil, tell them, that they muſt believe on his <hi>bare Word,</hi> that his Miracles were wrought by the Power of God and not of the Devil: But by plain Reaſon and ſtrong Argument taken from
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93177:110"/>the circumſtances of his Miracles; he proved againſt them that they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be from the Devil, and therefore they muſt be from God, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25, 26, 28, 29. He ſaid unto them — <hi>How can Satan caſt out Satan? And if a Kingdom be divided againſt it ſelf, that Kingdom cannot ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. The Summ of our Saviours Argument was this, That his Miracles were wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a Doctrine that is directly contrary to, and deſtructive of every thing that is Deviliſh; and wherever it is received in Faith and Love, there always the Devils Intereſt decays, and himſelf is deſpiſed and abhorred; yea many of Chriſts Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were done immediately upon the Devil himſelf, and he was thereby caſt out of that Power and Poſſeſſion, which he had got by Uſurpation over the Bodies and Souls of Men; and the ultimate end of them all, was to ſet up Gods Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, and to deſtroy Satans Kingdom. Therefore the Devil could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the Author of Chriſts Miracles, ſince they were directly contrary to his Nature, and deſtructive of his Kingdom and Intereſt in the World.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is evident, becauſe if the Devil be ſuppoſed to do ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſo circumſtantiated, he is and muſt be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſuppoſed to be a ſilly weak Prince, that for want of a Politick Head and Ambitious Heart acts quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto his own Nature, and doth what he can to deſtroy his own Kingdom and Intereſt in the World. But the Devil cannot be ſuppoſed to be a ſilly weak Prince, who ſo Acts for want of Policy and Pride: Such a Suppoſition is evidently falſe and ſelf-contradictious; for the Devil is a moſt Politick, proud Spirit, that is his very Nature as he is a Devil; and his Politick, proud Nature always Acts like it ſelf, and ever prompts him to defend, maintain and propagate his Kingdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt among Men.</p>
            <p>Therefore it's impoſſible that the Devil ſhould be the Author of ſuch Miracles as are ſo contrary to his Nature, and deſtructive of his Kingdom and Intereſt among Men; ſince it cannot be, that ſuch a Politick Ambitious Spirit as the Devil is, ſhould be ſo filly as to make war upon his own Subjects, pull down his own Kingdom, and take the Crown from his own and ſet it on anothers Head. This was our Lords Argument, whereby he proved his Miracles to be from God and not from Satan.</p>
            <p>And this Reaſon with others he hath given us, why we ſhould believe both his Doctrine and Miracles to be from Heaven; and doth no where require us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without any Reaſon. Now if neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles deſired Men to believe them upon their bare Word without good proof, who are <hi>we,</hi> and who is <hi>our Author,</hi> that either <hi>we</hi> or <hi>he</hi> ſhould deſire People to believe either the one or the other of us upon our bare Words without good proof? Eſpecially when the matter in Controverſie, is of the higheſt Nature and greateſt Importance, to wit, whether we preach <hi>a new Goſpel,</hi> which he affirms, and we deny; and without any Reaſon, but with a great many Falſhoods and Calumnies he affirms it; but with good and ſolid Reaſon we deny it, and have diſproved his Falſhoods, and wiped off his Calumnies.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things our Author reproaches us (as hath been ſhewed) with the Name of <hi>Rational</hi> Divines, by which it plainly appears, that he himſelf would not be accounted <hi>a Rational Preacher</hi> or <hi>Writer</hi> of matters of Divinity; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, he would not have the People to be <hi>Rational Hearers and Readers,</hi> but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that he either Preaches or Writes, without knowing any good Reaſon why or wherefore. But that which he caſts upon us as a reproach, we take it as a Crown, being rightly underſtood, as we have ſhewed it ought to be. And if we be indeed <hi>Rational</hi> Divines, we bleſs God who hath made us ſuch, and pray him
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93177:111"/>ſo to continue us, whileſt he hath any Service for us here; and ſtill to make us <hi>more Rational,</hi> that we may be the better able to open unto his People the true Grounds and Reaſons of the Chriſtian Faith. And as we deſire to be <hi>Rational</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in <hi>the ſenſe before explained,</hi> ſo we deſire that the People may be <hi>Rational Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Readers</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> ſo rational as not to receive every Doctrine they hear from the Pulpit, and read from the Preſs, without knowing by Scripture and Scriptural Reaſon, why and wherefore they receive it: Therefore we exhort and beſeech them to try before they truſt. <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God:
